The result of the event, probably, is not just a compact\nobject plus a spherical ejecta: within days, a fraction of the parent star\nfalls back to produce a thick accretion disk around the compact object.\nInstabilities in the disk induce sudden collapses with ejection of highly\nrelativistic ``cannonballs'' of plasma, similar to those ejected by\nmicroquasars. The jet of cannonballs exit the supernova shell/ejecta reheated\nby their collision with it, emitting highly forward-collimated radiation which\nis Doppler shifted to $\\gamma$-ray energy. Each cannonball corresponds to an\nindividual pulse in a GRB. They decelerate by sweeping up the ionised\ninterstellar matter in front of them, part of which is accelerated to\ncosmic-ray energies and emits synchrotron radiation: the afterglow. The\nCannonball Model cannot predict the timing sequence of these pulses, but it\nfares very well in describing the total energy, energy spectrum, and\ntime-dependence of the individual $\\gamma$-ray pulses and afterglows.

We first briefly summarize recent solar observations that give us\nhints on the role of plasmoid (flux rope) ejections in flare energy release. We\nthen discuss the plasmoid-induced-reconnection model, which is an extention of\nthe classical two-ribbon-flare model which we refer to as the CSHKP model. An\nessential ingredient of the new model is the formation and ejection of a\nplasmoid which play an essential role in the storage of magnetic energy (by\ninhibiting reconnection) and the induction of a strong inflow into reconnection\nregion. Using a simple analytical model, we show that the plasmoid ejection and\nacceleration are closely coupled with the reconnection process, leading to a\nnonlinear instability for the whole dynamics that determines the macroscopic\nreconnection rate uniquely. Next we show that the current sheet tends to have a\nfractal structure via the following process path: tearing, sheet thinning,\nSweet- Parker sheet, secondary tearing, further sheet thinning... These\nprocesses occur repeatedly at smaller scales until a microscopic plasma scale\n(either the ion Larmor radius or the ion inertial length) is reached where\nanomalous resistivity or collisionless reconnection can occur. The current\nsheet eventually has a fractal structure with many plasmoids (magnetic islands)\nof different sizes. When these plasmoids are ejected out of the current sheets,\nfast reconnection occurs at various different scales in a highly time dependent\nmanner. Finally, a scenario is presented for fast reconnection in the solar\ncorona on the basis of above plasmoid-induced-reconnection in a fractal current\nsheet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2001 02:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

As a first (typical) example we\nconsider a single electron which is strongly coupled with phonons on a $1D$\nchain of atoms --- the (Rashba)--Holstein polaron model. In the adiabatic\napproximation this system is conventionally described by the DNSE.

The reason behind this is the role of $M^*$, the sum of\nnucleon mass and its attractive self-energy in nuclear matter. Yet\nnonrelativistic calculations at a certain level of approximation are far less\ndifficult than comparative relativistic calculation. Naturally the question\narises if one can modify a nonrelativistic method, say, the lowest order\nBrueckner theory (LOBT), to reproduce approximately the results of a\nrelativistic calculation. While a many body effect, the role of $M^*$ is\nintrinsically relativistic. It cannot be simulated by adding multi-body forces\nin a nonrelativistic calculation. Instead, we examine if adding a set of\nrecipes to LOBT can be useful for the purpose. We point out that the\ndifferences in the results arise principally from two reasons - first, the role\nof $M^*$ and second, the disappearance in a relativistic treatment of the gap\nin the hole and particle energy spectra, present in LOBT. In this paper we show\nthat LOBT, modified by {\\it recipes} to remove these two reasons, generates\nresults quite close to those of Dirac-Brueckner theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2001 09:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
