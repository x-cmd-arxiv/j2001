We utilize the particular form of Einstein's field\nequation and propose for the $N$-body problem of the equations that are Lorentz\ninvariant a novel algorithm for the derivation of the equations of motion from\nthe field equations. It is: 1. Compute a static, spherically symmetric solution\nof the field equation. It will be singular at the origin. This will be taken to\nbe the field generated by a single particle. 2. Move the solution on a\ntrajectory $ {\\psi(t)}$ and apply the instantaneous Lorentz transformation\nbased on instantaneous velocity $\\dot{\\psi}(t)$. 3. Take, as first\napproximation, the field generated by $N$ particles to be the superposition of\nthe fields generated by the single particles. 4. Compute the leading part of\nthe equation.
