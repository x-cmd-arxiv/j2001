The Chandra ACIS\nobservation has clearly detected the lensed images of 2016+112 with positions\nin good agreement with those reported in the optical and also detects 13\nadditional X-ray sources within a radius of 3.5 arcmin. Previous X-ray\nobservations in the direction of 2016+112 with the ROSAT HRI and ASCA SIS have\ninterpreted the X-ray data as arising from extended emission from a dark\ncluster. However, the present Chandra observation can account for all the X-ray\nemission as originating from the lensed images and additional point X-ray\nsources in the field. Thus cluster parameters based on previous X-ray\nobservations are unreliable.

The lensed object is quite unusual, with reported narrow\nemission lines in the optical that suggest it may be a type-2 quasar (Yamada\net. al. 1999).

The 2-10 keV luminosity of the lensed\nobject, corrected for the lens magnification effect and using the above range\nof intrinsic absorption, is 3 x 10^43 - 1.4 x 10^44 erg/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2001 22:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The UV continuum of NGC\n4151 decreased by a factor of 4 over the previous two years, and we argue the\nchanges in the column density of the low ionization absorption lines associated\nwith the broad component at -490 km/s reflect the decrease in the ionizing\nflux. Most of the strong absorption lines (e.g., N V, C IV, Si IV) from this\ncomponent are saturated, but show substantial residual flux in their cores,\nindicating that the absorber does not fully cover the source of emission. Our\ninterpretation is that the unocculted light is due to scattering by free\nelectrons from an extended region, which reflects continuum, emission lines,\nand absorption lines. We have been able to constrain the densities for the\nkinematic components based on absorption lines from metastable states of C III\nand Fe II, and/or the ratios of ground and fine structure lines of O I,C II,\nand Si II. We have generated a set of photoionization models which match the\nionic column densities for each component during the present low flux state and\nthose seen in previous high flux states with the GHRS and STIS, confirming that\nthe absorbers are photoionized and respond to the changes in the continuum\nflux.

The spatial\nresolution (around 5 arcsec) allows us to disentangle the circumnuclear\nstarburst regions from the emission of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The\nglobal spatial distribution of the Unidentified Infrared Bands (UIBs) is\nsimilar to the cold dust component, traced by the 450 microns emission and the\ngaseous component obtained from the CO(1-0) map. However, a shift between the\nmaximum of the UIB and 450 microns emission is clearly seen in our maps. The\nUIBs in the MIR (5-16 microns) originate almost exclusively from the starburst\nregions in the galactic disk with an emission peaking at the extremity of the\nstellar/ gaseous bar at a distance of 1 kpc from the AGN. The spectrum of the\nnucleus is characterized over the whole 5-16 microns range by a strong\ncontinuum which can be fitted with a power law of index -1.7. Moreover, the\nhigh [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio (>2.5) in the nuclear region argues for a hard\nradiation field from the AGN. Observations indicate that the AGN in NGC 1068\ncontributes less than 5% to the total integrated UIB emission even though its\nhot dust continuum contributes as much as 75% to the total MIR flux.

Current fashionable supersymmetric models\nprovide a natural dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (LSP). The allowed parameter space of such models combined with fairly\nwell understood physics (quark substructure of the nucleon and nuclear\nstructure) permit the evaluation of the event rate for LSP-nucleus elastic\nscattering. The thus obtained event rates, which sensitively depend on the\nallowed parameter space parameters, are usually very low or even undetectable.\n  So, for background reduction, one would like to exploit two nice features of\nthe reaction, the directional rate, which depends on the sun's direction of\nmotion and the modulation effect, i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the\nearth's annual motion. In the present paper we study these phenomena in a\nspecific class of non isothermal models, which take into account the late\nin-fall of dark matter into our galaxy, producing flows of caustic rings. We\nfind that the modulation effect arising from such models is smaller than that\nfound previously with isothermal symmetric velocity distributions and much\nsmaller compared to that obtained using a realistic asymmetric distribution\nwith enhanced dispersion in the galactocentric direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2001 19:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

We apply our general results to study\nthe classes of GEQS that include a system with a cranked Hamiltonian\n$H(t)=e^{-iKt}H_0e^{iKt}$. We show that the cranking operator $K$ also belongs\nto this class. Hence, in spite of the fact that it is time-independent, it\nleads to nontrivial cyclic evolutions and geometric phases. Our analysis allows\nfor an explicit construction of a complete set of nonstationary cyclic states\nof any time-independent simple harmonic oscillator. The period of these cyclic\nstates is half the characteristic period of the oscillator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2001 19:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 May 2001 11:26:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2001 08:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The axial angle can be made\na function of the two polar angles, and different choices of the functional\ndependence are analogous to different gauges of a magnetic field. Symmetries\nbroken by a choice of gauge are re-established by transformations within the\ngauge group. The approach allows several previous proposals to be related.\nBecause of the coupling of the photon momentum and spin, our position operator,\nlike that proposed by Pryce, is a matrix that does not commute with the spin\noperator. Unlike the Pryce operator, however, our operator has commuting\ncomponents, but the commutators of these components with the total angular\nmomentum require an extra term to rotate the matrices for each vector component\naround the momentum direction. Several proofs of the nonexistence of a photon\nposition operator with commuting components are based on overly restrictive\npremises that do not apply here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2001 03:26:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2001 14:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-22"}
