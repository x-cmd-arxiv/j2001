The theory\noutlined in this paper relates the intrinsic properties of NS structure to the\nobserved kHz frequencies. The range of kHz frequencies and the observed quality\nfactors (Qs) are also explained by this simple dynamical model. A scenario that\nbegins with the melting of the inner crust of an LMXB NS creates the conditions\nnecessary for the generation of kHz QPO.

This circle is intimately bound up\nwith the extrinsic geometry of the leaves of F. In particular, for any pair of\nleaves m,l of the universal cover of F with m>l, the leaf l is asymptotic to m\nin a dense set of directions at infinity, where the leaf space is co-oriented\nso that the foliation branches in the negative direction. This is a macroscopic\nversion of an infinitesimal result of Thurston's and gives much more drastic\ncontrol over the topology and geometry of F.\n  The pair of laminations can be used to produce a pseudo-Anosov flow\ntransverse to F which is regulating in the non-branching direction. Rigidity\nresults for these laminations in the R-covered case are extended to the case of\none-sided branching. In particular, an R-covered foliation can only be deformed\nto a foliation with one-sided branching along one of the two laminations\ncanonically associated to the R-covered foliation in math.GT/9903173, and these\nlaminations become exactly the laminations constructed for the new branched\nfoliation.\n  Other corollaries include that the ambient manifold is d-hyperbolic in the\nsense of Gromov, and that a self-homeomorphism of this manifold homotopic to\nthe identity is isotopic to the identity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2001 20:56:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2001 20:05:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2002 19:37:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2002 20:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
