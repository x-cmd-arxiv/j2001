This generalizes the model we derived previously for an Einstein-de\nSitter (EdS) universe. The model is based upon the assumption that cosmological\nhaloes form from the collapse and virialization of top-hat density\nperturbations and are spherical, isotropic, and isothermal. This leads to the\nprediction of a unique, nonsingular, truncated isothermal sphere (TIS), a\nparticular solution of the Lane-Emden equation (modified for nonzero\ncosmological constant). The size and virial temperature are unique functions of\nthe mass and redshift of formation of the object for a given background\nuniverse. The central density is roughly proportional to the critical density\nof the universe at the epoch of collapse.

One\ncomponent of the coupled cavity (conversion cavity) made of oxygen-free\nhigh-conductivity copper is used to convert an axion into a single photon with\nthe Primakoff process in the strong magnetic field, while the other component\n(detection cavity) made of Nb is utilized to detect the converted photons with\nRydberg atoms passed through it without magnetic field.\n  Top of the detection cavity is attached to the bottom flange of the mixing\nchamber of a dilution refrigerator, thus the whole cavity is cooled down to 10\nmK range to reduce the background thermal blackbody-photons in the cavity.\n  The cavity resonant frequency is tunable over $\\sim$ 15% by moving dielectric\nrods inserted independently into each part of the cavities along the\ncylindrical axis. In order to reduce the heat load from the higher temperature\nside to the most cooled dilution refrigerator part, the tuning rod at the\nconversion cavity is especially driven via the Kevlar strings with a stepping\nmotor outside the cryostat at room temperature.\n  The lowest temperature achieved up to now is 12 $\\sim$ 15 mK for the long\nperiod operation and the loaded Q value at low temperature is 3.5 $\\sim$ 4.5\n$\\times$ $10^4$ for the whole range of frequency tuning.

Plotted as\ndistance vs. recession speed, a disturbing non-linearity is found which has led\nto speculations about \"dark energy\" which somehow acts like anti-gravity. This\nstudy finds a full explanation in relativity theory. The metric of space\nshrinks, in the presence of a gravitational potential, V, by exp(V/c^2). Early\nin the big bang, when the SN1a's sent their signals, V was larger than now. By\nfitting the data to a relativistic model, we probe the metric of the early big\nbang. V, due to all mass in the big bang, is a billion times larger than that\nprovided by earth gravity alone. The big bang is modeled as a sphere of\nconstant density, of radius R_0 = cT. The metrics of time and distance shrink,\neach by alpha = exp(V/c^2, and this study finds the data fitted by 1/alpha =\n1.55. Earlier, 1/alpha was much larger. As with the deflection of starlight and\nthe Shapiro time delay, gravity affects space like an index of refraction,\nn=1/alpha^2. The Hubble concept remains valid, but with geometric distance\ninstead of optical distance.
