NHS orbits exist in the very strong field of any black hole with\nspin $a\\agt 0.952412M$. Their unusual behavior is due to the locking of\nparticle motion near the event horizon to the hole's spin, and is therefore a\nsignature of the Kerr metric's extreme strong field. An observational hallmark\nof NHS orbits is that a small body spiraling into a Kerr black hole due to\ngravitational-wave emission will be driven into orbits of progressively smaller\ninclination angle, toward the equator. This is in contrast to the ``normal''\nbehavior. For circular orbits, the change in inclination is very small, and\nunlikely to be of observational importance. I argue that the change in\ninclination may be considerably larger when one considers the evolution of\ninclined eccentric orbits. If this proves correct, then the gravitational waves\nproduced by evolution through the NHS regime may constitute a very interesting\nand important probe of the strong-field nature of rotating black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2001 22:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is shown\nthat the generation of Alfven waves is possible during the total time of plasma\nexpansion. The maximum intensity of these waves corresponds to the time of\ncomplete retardation of the diamagnetic cavity created by the expansion of\nplasma cloud. The Alfven wave exhibits a form of an impulse with an effective\nfrequency ~ 0.03-0.05 Hz.
