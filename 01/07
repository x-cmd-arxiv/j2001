We developed a new analysis method\nfor the ASCA data to resolve discrete sources from the extended Galactic ridge\nX-ray emission (GRXE). We resolved 163 discrete sources with a flux down to\n10^-12.5 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 and determined the intensity variations of the GRXE as\na function of the Galactic longitude with a spatial resolution of ~1 deg. The\nlongitudinal variation of the GRXE in the energy band above 4 keV shows a large\nenhancement within |l|<30 deg. This suggests a strong enhancement of X-ray\nemissivity inside the 4-kpc arms. Searches for identifications of the resolved\nsources with cataloged X-ray sources and optical stars show that the 66% are\nunidentified. Spectral analysis of each source shows that a large number of the\nunidentified sources have hard X-ray spectra. We classified the sources into\nseveral groups according to the spectra and analyzed the spectra summed within\neach group. Possible X-ray origins of these sources are discussed based on the\ngrouping analysis. Also, we derived the LogN-LogS relations of the resolved\nsources in the energy bands below and above 2 keV. The obtained LogN-LogS\nrelation of the Galactic X-ray sources above 2 keV is represented by a\npower-law with an index of -0.79+/-0.07. This flat LogN-LogS relation suggests\nthat the spatial distribution of the sources should have an arm-like structure\nin which the Solar system is included. The integrated surface brightness of the\nresolved sources is about 10% of the total GRXE in both energy bands. The\napproximately 90% of the emission remaining is still unresolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 2001 08:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}

There are two reasons to\nstudy this class of triangular Hopf algebras: First, it contains all known\nexamples of finite-dimensional triangular Hopf algebras; second, it can be, in\na sense, \"completely understood\". Namely, it was shown in our previous work\nwith Andruskiewitsch that any finite-dimensional triangular Hopf algebra with\nthe Chevalley property is obtained by twisting of a finite-dimensional\ntriangular Hopf algebra with R-matrix of rank at most 2 which, in turn, is\nobtained by \"modifying\" the group algebra of a finite supergroup. This provides\na classification of such Hopf algebras.\n  The goal of this paper is to make this classification more effective and\nexplicit, i.e. to parameterize isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional\ntriangular Hopf algebras with the Chevalley property by group-theoretical\nobjects, similarly to how it was done in our previous work in the semisimple\ncase. This is achieved in Theorem 2.2, where these classes are put in bijection\nwith certain septuples of data. In the semisimple case, the septuples reduce to\nthe quadruples, and we recover the result of our previous paper. In the minimal\ntriangular pointed case, we recover a classification theorem from a previous\npaper of the second author.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jan 2001 18:36:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
