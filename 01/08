These stars are mainly giants of late M spectral\ntype, evolving along the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). They are found to\npossess a wide and continuous distribution of pulsation periods and to obey an\napproximate log~period -- bolometric magnitude relation or set of such\nrelations.\n  Approximate mass-loss rates in the range of 1e-8 to 5e-7 M_sun per year are\nderived from ISOGAL mid-infrared photometry and models of stellar spectra\nadjusted for the presence of optically-thin circumstellar silicate dust.\nMass-loss rates depend on luminosity and pulsation period. Some stars lose mass\nas rapidly as short-period Miras but do not show Mira-like amplitudes. A period\nof 70 days or longer is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for mass\nloss to occur.\n  For AGB stars in the mass-loss ranges that we observe, the functional\ndependence of mass-loss rate on temperature and luminosity is found to be in\nagreement with recent theoretical predictions. If we include our mass-loss\nrates with a sample of extreme mass-losing AGB stars in the Large Magellanic\nCloud, we get the general result for AGB stars that mass-loss rate is\nproportional to luminosity^{2.7}, valid for AGB stars with 10^{-8} to 10^{-4}\nM_sun per year (Abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 2001 19:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
