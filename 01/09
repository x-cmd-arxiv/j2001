The PICsIT telescope is\nthe high energy (150 keV - 10 MeV) plane of the IBIS imager and consists of 8\nindividual modules of 512 detection elements. The modules are arranged in a 4 x\n2 pattern, while the pixels are in a 16 x 32 array. This layout, which includes\na dead area equivalent to one pixel width between each module, together with\nthe event selection procedure, which (in standard mode) does not allow the\nidentification of coincidences between separate modules, leads to a\nnon-uniformity of the background which is significantly different for\nsingle-site events and for multiple energy deposits. Other sources of\nbackground variations range from the separate low energy detector, situated\nimmediately above the PICsIT plane, to the large mass of the SPI telescope at a\nshort distance to one side. The algorithms for performing all the imaging and\nspectral deconvolution for PICsIT are currently being produced for delivery to\nthe INTEGRAL Science Data Centre. In order to maximise the information which\nmay be extracted from the PICsIT data, we have designed a prototyping\nenvironment which consists of a GUI to a highly structured and modular set of\nprocedures which allows the easy simulation of observations from the data\ncollection phase through to the final image production and analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2001 08:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Sect.1 reviews briefly the commonly\nused measuring techniques.

However the effect\nthat the Strong Principle of Equivalence (SPOE) has on the curved and flat\nbi-metric spacetime tetrad structure has not been fully explored. In the\ncontext of bi-metric General Relativity the (SPOE) requires that: a) in the\nabsence of gravitation due to spacetime curvature a Global Inertial Cartesian\nMinkowski (GICM) spacetime frame exists in which Special Relativity is valid\nand, b) in the presence of gravitation due to spacetime curvature a bi-metric\nLocal Free Fall frame (LFF) must always exist. These two conditions required by\nthe (SPOE) are then shown to imply that a symmetric gravitational potential\ntensor must exist in the bi-metric spacetime which is connected exponentially\nto the tetrad inner product between the curved symmetric tetrads and the flat\nbackground symmetric tetrads.

This interaction generates an infrared integrable\nsingularity and we detail the computationally intensive procedure necessary for\nnumerical solution.
