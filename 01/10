Using\nthe cluster radio galaxy database from Miller & Owen (2001) and optical\nspectroscopy and high resolution radio images to remove AGN, we assess the\nFIR/radio correlation of cluster galaxies from the centers of the clusters out\nwell past the classical Abell radius. The FIR/radio correlation is shown to\nhold quite well for star forming galaxies, and the FIR and radio fluxes for\ncluster AGN are also well correlated. In the case of AGN, the relative radio-\nto-FIR fluxes are greater and the scatter in the correlation is larger than\nthose seen for star forming galaxies. We also find that there is a rare but\nstatistically significant excess of star forming galaxies with enhanced radio\nemission in the centers of the clusters, and that the degree of this\nenhancement is typically a factor of two or three. The FIR/radio correlation\nfor cluster star forming galaxies is also tested against line-of-sight velocity\nrelative to the cluster systemic velocities, but no significant correlation is\nfound. While the radial dependence of the FIR/radio correlation is consistent\nwith the model wherein ram pressure increases the cluster galaxies' magnetic\nfield strengths through compression, the velocity data do not confirm this\nmodel. Although a contribution from ram pressure can not be ruled out, the\nthermal pressure due to the ICM alone is an equally viable alternative.

We study in detail the effect of a \\emph{single} chipping site on\nthe steady state in arbitrary dimensions, with and without bias. In the\nthermodynamic limit, the system can exist in one of the following phases -- (a)\nPinned Aggregate (PA) phase in which an infinite aggregate (with mass\nproportional to the volume of the system) appears with probability one at the\nchipping site but not in the bulk. (b) Unpinned Aggregate (UA) phase in which\n$\\emph{both}$ the chipping site and the bulk can support an infinite aggregate\nsimultaneously. (c) Non Aggregate (NA) phase in which there is no infinite\ncluster. Our analytical and numerical studies show that the system exists in\nthe UA phase in all cases except in 1d with bias. In the latter case, there is\na phase transition from the NA phase to the PA phase as density is increased. A\nvariant of the above aggregation model is also considered in which total\nparticle number is conserved and chipping occurs at a fixed site, but the\nparticles do not interact with each other at other sites.

Generally, spin is\nconsidered to be the source of torsion, but there are several other\npossibilities in which torsion emerges in different contexts. In some cases a\nphenomenological counterpart is absent, in some other cases torsion arises from\nsources without spin as a gradient of a scalar field. Accordingly, we propose\ntwo classification schemes. The first one is based on the possibility to\nconstruct torsion tensors from the product of a covariant bivector and a vector\nand their respective space-time properties. The second one is obtained by\nstarting from the decomposition of torsion into three irreducible pieces. Their\nspace-time properties again lead to a complete classification. The\nclassifications found are given in a U_4, a four dimensional space-time where\nthe torsion tensors have some peculiar properties. The irreducible\ndecomposition is useful since most of the phenomenological work done for\ntorsion concerns four dimensional cosmological models. In the second part of\nthe paper two applications of these classification schemes are given. The\nmodifications of energy-momentum tensors are considered that arise due to\ndifferent sources of torsion. Furthermore, we analyze the contributions of\ntorsion to shear, vorticity, expansion and acceleration.
