I find that this peak is caused by the absence of colder dust that\nemits at 60 micron and not by an excess of hot dust, as suggested by the name.\nOn optical images, the 25 micron-peakers show a lack of extended dust. The\npeakers are consistent with being in a later evolutionary stage, in which all\nthe extended dust has been formed into stars and the dust torus is smaller. If\nthe 60 micron dust is heated by stars, there might be a correlation between the\nstar-formation rate and the power of the AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2001 10:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Two different sets of the critical\nexponents have been considered - one provided by the usual (perturbative)\nrenormalization group (RG) theory, and another predicted by grouping of Feynman\ndiagrams in phi^4 model (our theory). The test consists of two steps. First we\ndetermine the critical coupling by fitting the MC data to the theoretical\nexpression, including both confluent and analytical corrections to scaling, the\nvalues of critical exponents being taken from theory.

We show, by exploiting the Talmi integral\nexpansion, that hard-core potentials can be systematically softened by the\nintroduction of a series of contact operators familiar from effective field\ntheory. The coefficients of these operators can be run analytically by a\nrenormalization group method in a scheme-independent way, with the introduction\nof suitable counterterms. Once these coefficients are run to the shell model\nscale, we show that the renormalized coefficients contain all of the\ninformation needed to evaluate perturbative insertions of the remaining soft\npotential.
