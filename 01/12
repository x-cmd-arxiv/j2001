We\nconfirm the presence of generally steeper X-ray continua in narrow-line Seyfert\n1 galaxies (NLS1s) compared to broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Seyfert 2\ngalaxies show photon indices similar to those of NLS1s. Whereas a tendency for\nan increasing X-ray luminosity with increasing interaction strength is found\nfor Seyfert 1 galaxies, such a correlation is not found for Seyfert 2 galaxies.\nFor Seyfert 1 galaxies we found also a strong correlation for increasing\nfar-infrared luminosity with increasing interaction strength. Both NLS1s and\nSeyfert 2 galaxies show the highest values of far-infrared luminosity compared\nto Seyfert 1 galaxies, suggesting that NLS1s and Seyfert 2 galaxies host strong\n(cirumnuclear) starformation.

We have focused on the case of a nematic confined by opposing\nflat surfaces, in slab geometry (slit pore), which favor planar molecular\nalignment (parallel to the surface) and homeotropic alignment (perpendicular to\nthe surface), respectively. The spatial dependence of the tilt angle of the\ndirector with respect to the surface normal has been studied, as well as the\ntensorial order parameter describing the molecular order around the director.\nFor a pore of given width, we find that, for weak surface fields, the alignment\nof the nematic director is perpendicular to the surface in a region next to the\nsurface favoring homeotropic alignment, and parallel along the rest of the\npore, with a interface separating these regions (S phase). For strong surface\nfields, the director is distorted uniformly, the tilt angle exhibiting a linear\ndependence with the distance normal to the surface (L phase). Our calculations\nreveal the existence of a first-order transition between the two director\nconfigurations, which is driven by changes in the surface field strength, and\nalso by changes in the pore width. In the latter case the transition occurs,\nfor a given surface field, between the S phase for narrow pores and the L phase\nfor wider pores.
