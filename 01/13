The evolution\nof emission lines and photometric magnitudes indicates that the Be star\nundergoes relatively fast (~ 3-5 yr) quasi-cyclic activity, losing and\nreforming its circumstellar disc. We show that the general optical, infrared\nand X-ray behaviour can be explained by the dynamical evolution of the viscous\ncircumstellar disc around the Be star. After each disc-loss episode, the disc\nstarts reforming and grows until it reaches the radius at which the resonant\ninteraction of the neutron star truncates it. At some point, the disc becomes\nunstable to (presumably radiative) warping and then tilts and starts\nprecessing. The tilting is very large and disc precession leads to a succession\nof single-peaked and shell profiles in the emission lines. Type II X-ray\noutbursts take place after the disc has been strongly disturbed and we\nspeculate that the distortion of the disc leads to interaction with the\norbiting neutron star.\n  We discuss the implications of these correlated optical/X-ray variations for\nthe different models proposed to explain the occurrence of X-ray outbursts in\nBe/X-ray binaries. We show that the hypothesis of mass ejection events as the\ncause of the spectacular variability and X-ray outbursts is unlikely to be\nmeaningful for any Be/X-ray binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2001 16:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
