The conditions required for XSW to\nappear in the space between two polished parallel plane plates are formulated\nand a slit size interval conforming to these conditions is evaluated. A\nmechanism of a XSW intensity decrease in a planar waveguide is proposed. This\nmechanism explains a high efficiency of slitless collimator application for the\ntransportation of narrow X-Ray beams.\n  Some recommendations on the application of the planar X-Ray waveguide in\nX-Ray structural and spectral studies of surface are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jan 2001 15:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
