In this study,\nradiative transfer calculations have been performed to search for an\nalternative explanation to the lack of crystalline silicate features in the\nspectrum of low mass-loss rate AGB stars.

Since\nthis implies that low mass-loss rate AGB stars might also form crystalline\nsilicates and deposit them into the Interstellar Medium (ISM), the described\nobservational selection effect may put the process of dust formation around AGB\nstars and the composition of the predominantly amorphous dust in the\nInterstellar Medium in a different light.

The kinematical relations between wave vectors of the\nplasmino and plasmon are derived, when the effective pumping over of the plasma\nexcitation energy from the fermion branch of plasma excitations to the boson\nbranch and vice versa occur. The expression for the nonlinear Landau damping\nrate of a plasmino at rest is found, and a comparison with a plasmino damping\nconstant obtained within the framework of the hard thermal loop approximation\nis made. The nonlinear Landau damping rate for normal quark excitations is\nshown to diverge like $1/\\sqrt{q^2}$ near the light cone where $q$ is a\nfour-momentum of excitations, and the improved Blaizot-Iancu equations removing\nthis divergence are proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2001 01:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2001 08:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
