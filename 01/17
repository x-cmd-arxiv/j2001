The trouble with\nsuch schemes is that effective gravity itself vanishes. We explore the\npossibility of avoiding this ``no-go'' with a spatially varying effective\ngravity. We demonstrate this in principle with the non-minimally coupled scalar\nfield having an additional coupling to a fermionic field. The expectation value\nof the scalar field gets anchored to a non-trivial value inside compact\ndomains. But for the non-minimal coupling to the scalar curvature, these\nconfigurations are analogous to the non-topological solutions suggested by Lee\nand Wick. With non-minimal coupling, this leads to a peculiar spatial variation\nof effective gravity. As before, one can dynamically have the long distance\n(global) gravitational constant $G$ and ${\\Lambda}$, the cosmological constant,\ntending to zero. However, inside compact domains, $G$ can be held to a\nuniversal (non-vanishing) value. Long distance gravitational effects turn out\nto be indistinguishable from those expected of general theory of relativity\n(GTR).

The propagation of the waves is\nstrongly dependent on the shape of the DNA thus proteins that change the shape\nof DNA can alter signal transmission. The overall effect is a method of signal\nprocessing by DNA binding proteins that creates a \"cellular communications\nnetwork\".\n  The propagation of small amplitude disturbances through DNA is treated\naccording to the mechanical theory of elastic rods. According to the theory\nfour types of mechanical waves affecting extension(compression), twist, bend or\nshear can propagate through DNA. Each type of wave has unique characteristic\nproperties. Disturbances affecting all wave types can propagate independently\nof each other. Using a linear approximation to the theory of motion of elastic\nrods, the dispersion of these waves is investigated. The phase velocities of\nthe waves lies in the range 5-8 angstroms/ps using constants suitable for a\ndescription of DNA. The dispersion of all wave types of arbitrary wave length\nis investigated for a straight, twisted rod.\n  Based on these findings, we propose all-atom numerical simulations of DNA to\ninvestigate the propagation of these waves as an alternative measure of the\nwave velocity and dispersion analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2001 01:58:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2001 00:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 May 2001 21:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
