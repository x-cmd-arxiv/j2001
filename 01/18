Despite the biases inherent in some\nof these surveys, and the crudeness of the redshift information available in\nothers, I conclude that all current information suggests that only 10-15 % of\nluminous sub-mm sources lie at z < 2, and that the median redshift of this\npopulation is z ~ 3.

In such scenarios,\npeak AGN emission is expected to correspond to, or even to cause termination of\nmajor star-formation activity in the host spheroid. In contrast, maximum dust\nemission is expected to occur roughly half-way through the star-formation\nprocess. Given that optical emission from bright quasars peaks at z = 2.5,\ndust-emission from massive ellipticals might be reasonably expected to peak at\nsome point in the preceding ~ 1 Gyr, at z ~ 3.

At the same time, M31* is apparently thousands\nof times more luminous in X-rays than its Galactic Center counterpart. Thus, a\ncomparative study of these objects can be valuable in helping us to understand\nthe underlying physical basis for their activity. We show here that the\naccretion model being developed for Sgr A* comprises two branches of solutions,\ndistinguished by the relative importance of cooling compared to compressional\nheating at the radius $r_C$ where the ambient gas is captured by the black\nhole. For typical conditions in the ISM, the initial temperature ($T[r_C]\\sim\n10^6-10^7$ K) sits on the unstable branch of the cooling function.\n  Depending on the actual value of $T(r_C)$ and the accretion rate, the plasma\nsettles either onto a hot branch (attaining a temperature as high as $10^{10}\nK$ or so at small radii) or a cold branch, in which $T$ drops to $\\sim 10^4$ K.\nSgr A* is presumably a `hot' black hole. We show here that the VLA, UV and {\\it\nChandra} observations of M31* reveal it to be a member of the `cold' black hole\nfamily. We discuss several predicted features in the spectrum of M31* that may\nbe testable by future multi-wavelength observations, including the presence of\na prominent UV spike (from hydrogen line emission) that would be absent on the\nhot branch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2001 15:51:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2001 04:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

This equation is the\nstandard linearized conjugacy equation for germs of holomorphic maps in a\nneighborhood of a fixed point. The parameter is the eigenvalue $q$ of the\nlinear part. This problem has been first investigated by Arnol'd and Herman.\nHerman raised the question whether the solutions of the cohomological equation\nhad a quasianalytic dependence on the parameter. Indeed they are analytic\noutside $\\S^1$ which is a natural boundary but the solutions are still defined\nat points of $\\S^1$ which lie ``far enough from resonances''. We adapt to our\ncase Herman's construction of an increasing sequence of compacts which avoid\nresonances and prove that the solutions belong to the associated space of\nmonogenic functions. The solutions admit asymptotic expansions at the points of\n$\\S^1$ which satisfy some arithmetical condition, and Carleman's Theorem allows\nus to answer negatively to the question of quasianalyticity at these points.\nBut resonances (roots of unity) lead to asymptotic expansions, for which\nquasianalyticity is obtained as a particular case of \\'Ecalle's theory of\nresurgent functions. At constant-type points one can still recover the\nsolutions from their asymptotic expansions and obtain a special kind of\nquasianalyticity. Our results are obtained by reducing the problem to the study\nof a fundamental solution (which is the ``quantum logarithm''). We deduce as a\ncorollary of our work the proof of a conjecture of Gammel on the monogenic and\nquasianalytic properties of a certain number-theoretical Borel-Wolff-Denjoy\nseries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2001 08:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The squeezing\ncan be controlled by choosing appropiate collision parameters or by\nmanipulating the motional states of the two components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2001 09:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The theoretical model,\nvalid at all length scales, relates mass oscillations to static electric and\ngravity fields. The same concept is used, with substantially lower frequencies,\nto compute the intensity of gravity waves within the solar system. These waves,\nin the range of kilohertz, can in principle be detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2001 13:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
