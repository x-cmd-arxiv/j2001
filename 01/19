Our photometry is deep enough to cover the complete main sequence B\nspectral type. We identify ~50 very likely members of the cluster down to\nspectral type B9-A0, some of which have much higher reddenings than the\naverage. We derive a color excess E(b-y) = 0.33+-0.03 and a dereddened distance\nmodulus V_0 - M_V = 13.9+-0.2. From the beta index, we identify several\ncandidates as emission-line stars, for which we have obtained spectroscopy.\nThree of them display spectra corresponding to spectral type F, but showing\nH-alpha in emission. Photometric measurements in this and previous studies\nindicate strong variability. These characteristics show them to be\npre-main-sequence stars of spectral type F. We also identify two likely Herbig\nBe stars. These results hint at the existence of a sizable pre-main-sequence\npopulation in NGC 1893.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2001 14:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We have linearized the time-independent two-fluid equations about the\nexact solution for a vortex, and find three solutions which are important in\nthe region far from the vortex. Uniform superfluid flow gives rise to the usual\nsuperfluid Magnus force. Uniform normal fluid flow gives rise to no forces in\nthe linear region, but does not satisfy reasonable boundary conditions at short\ndistances. A logarithmically increasing normal fluid flow gives a viscous\nforce. As in classical hydrodynamics, and as in the early work of Hall and\nVinen, this logarithmic increase must be cut off by nonlinear effects at large\ndistances; this gives a viscous force proportional to u/ln(u), and a transverse\ncontribution which goes like u/(ln u)^2, even in the absence of an explicit\nIordanskii force. In the limit u goes to zero the TAN result is obtained, but\nat nonzero u there are important corrections that were not found in TAN.

Webster and\nCates (Langmuir, 1998, 14, 2068-2079) gave rigorous criteria for osmotic\nstabilisation of mono- and polydisperse emulsions, in the dilute regime. We\nconsider here whether analogous criteria exist for the osmotic stabilisation of\nmono- and polydisperse concentrated emulsions and foams, and suggest that the\npressure differences driving coarsening are small compared to the mean Laplace\npressure. An exact calculation confirms this for a monodisperse 2D model,\nfinding a bubble's pressure as P_i = P + Pi + P_i^G, with P, Pi the atmospheric\nand osmotic pressures, and P_i^G a ``geometric pressure'' that reduces to the\nLaplace pressure only for a spherical bubble. For Princen's 2D emulsion model,\nP_i^G is only 5% larger in the dry limit than the dilute limit. We conclude\nthat osmotic stabilisation of dense systems typically requires a pressure of\ntrapped molecules in each droplet that is comparable to the Laplace pressures\nthe same droplets would have if spherical, as opposed to the much larger\nLaplace pressures present in the system. We study coarsening of foams and\nconcentrated emulsions when there is insufficient of the trapped species\npresent. Rate-limiting mechanisms are considered, their applicability and\nassociated droplet growth rates discussed. In a concentrated foam or emulsion,\na finite yield threshold for droplet rearrangement may be enough to prevent\ncoarsening of the remainder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2001 12:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This is modeled after a\nnon-commutative scheme type of theory for the curved finitary spacetime sheaves\nof the non-abelian incidence Rota algebras that represent `gravitational\nquantum causal sets'. The finitary spacetime primitive algebra scheme\nstructures for quantum causal sets proposed here are interpreted as the\nkinematics of a curved and reticular local quantum causality. Dynamics for\nquantum causal sets is then represented by appropriate scheme morphisms, thus\nit has a purely categorical description that is manifestly `gauge-independent'.\nHence, a schematic version of the Principle of General Covariance of General\nRelativity is formulated for the dynamically variable quantum causal sets. We\ncompare our non-commutative scheme-theoretic curved quantum causal topology\nwith some recent $C^{*}$-quantale models for non-abelian generalizations of\nclassical commutative topological spaces or locales, as well as with some\nrelevant recent results obtained from applying sheaf and topos-theoretic ideas\nto quantum logic proper.

At the end we conjecture that the\nfundamental quantum time-asymmetry that Penrose has expected to be the main\ncharacteristic of the elusive `true quantum gravity' is possibly of a\nkinematical or structural rather than of a dynamical character, and we also\ndiscuss the possibility of a unified description of quantum logic and quantum\ngravity in quantum topos-theoretic terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2001 13:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2001 10:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our purpose here is to explain the\nmodel independent consequences of the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD for\ntwo famous results concerning the structure of the nucleon. We show that both\nthe apparent success of the constituent quark model in reproducing the ratio of\nthe proton to neutron magnetic moments and the apparent success of the Foldy\nterm in reproducing the observed charge radius of the neutron are coincidental.\nThat is, a relatively small change of the current quark mass would spoil both\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2001 04:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}

The\nintroductory part of the review is intended to be accessible to the general\nreader. M-theory is an eleven-dimensional quantum theory of gravity which is\nbelieved to underlie all superstring theories. This is the only candidate at\npresent for a theory of fundamental physics which reconciles gravity and\nquantum field theory in a potentially realistic fashion. Evidence for the\nexistence of M-theory is still only circumstantial---no complete\nbackground-independent formulation of the theory yet exists. Matrix theory was\nfirst developed as a regularized theory of a supersymmetric quantum membrane.\nMore recently, the theory appeared in a different guise as the discrete\nlight-cone quantization of M-theory in flat space. These two approaches to\nmatrix theory are described in detail and compared. It is shown that matrix\ntheory is a well-defined quantum theory which reduces to a supersymmetric\ntheory of gravity at low energies. Although the fundamental degrees of freedom\nof matrix theory are essentially pointlike, it is shown that higher-dimensional\nfluctuating objects (branes) arise through the nonabelian structure of the\nmatrix degrees of freedom. The problem of formulating matrix theory in a\ngeneral space-time background is discussed, and the connections between matrix\ntheory and other related models are reviewed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2001 00:19:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2001 19:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
