The behavior of polyelectrolytes is markedly different from that\nof neutral polymers. In bulk solutions, i.e. disregarding the surface effect,\nthere are two unique features to charged polymers: first, due to the presence\nof long-ranged electrostatic repulsion between charged monomers, the polymer\nconformations are much more extended, giving rise to a very small overlap\nconcentration and high solution viscosity. Second, the presence of a large\nnumber of counter-ions increases the osmotic pressure of polyelectrolyte\nsolutions, making such polymers water soluble as is of great importance to many\napplications. At surfaces, the same interplay between monomer-monomer repulsion\nand counter-ion degrees of freedom leads to a number of special properties. In\nparticular, the adsorption behavior depends on both the concentration of\npolymers and added salt in the bulk. We first describe the adsorption behavior\nof single polyelectrolyte molecules, and discuss the necessary conditions to\nobtain an adsorbed layer and characterize its width.

In particular\na scalar glueball is firmly expected at a mass of about 1730 MeV. This\nprediction has led to an intense study of scalar isoscalar interactions and to\nthe discovery of new meson resonances. The number of scalar states observed\nseems to exceed the number of states which can be accommodated in the quark\nmodel even when two states, the a_0(980) and f_0(980), are interpreted as K\nKbar bound states and are removed from the list. However, none of these states\nhas a decay pattern which is consistent with that of a pure glueball. A\nreasonable interpretation of the number of states and of their decay pattern is\nfound only when mixing of scalar q qbar states with the scalar glueball is\ntaken into account.\n  In this paper we scrutinize the evidence for these states and their\nproduction characteristics. The f_0(1370) - a cornerstone of all qbar\nq-glueball mixing scenarios - is shown to be likely of non-qbar q nature. The\nremaining scalar states then do fit into a nonet classification. If this\ninterpretation should be correct there would be no room for resonant scalar\ngluon-gluon interactions, no room for the scalar glueball.\n  We also discuss the status of mesons with exotic quantum numbers, of mesons\nwhich cannot possibly have qbar q structure, and argue that these are, most\nlikely, four-quark states and not excitations of the gluon string providing the\nbinding between quark and antiquark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2001 16:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
