This is equivalent to a\ncelebrated theorem of Euler. Of the many proofs that have appeared since Euler,\na simple one was discovered only recently by Calabi: the sum is written as a\ndefinite integral over the unit n-cube, then transformed into the volume of a\npolytope Pi_n in R^n whose vertices' coordinates are rational multiples of pi.\nWe review Calabi's proof, and give two further interpretations. First we define\na simple linear operator T on L^2(0,pi/2), and show that T is self-adjoint and\ncompact, and that Vol(Pi_n) is the trace of T^n. We find that the spectrum of T\nis {1/(4k+1) : k in Z}, with each eigenvalue 1/(4k+1) occurring with\nmultiplicity 1; thus Vol(Pi_n) is the sum of the n-th powers of these\neigenvalues. We also interpret Vol(Pi_n) combinatorially in terms of the number\nof alternating permutations of n+1 letters, and if n is even also in terms of\nthe number of cyclically alternating permutations of n letters. We thus relate\nthese numbers with S(n) without the intervention of Bernoulli and Euler numbers\nor their generating functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jan 2001 17:57:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2001 19:55:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2002 02:53:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2003 01:11:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2003 15:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
