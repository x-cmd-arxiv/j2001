The\naim of this paper is to give mathematical foundations to Holonomic Quantum\nComputation (Computer) proposed by Zanardi and Rasetti (quant-ph/9904011) and\nPachos and Chountasis (quant-ph/9912093). In 2-qubit case we give an explicit\nform to non-abelian Berry connection of quantum computational bundle which is\nassociated with Holonomic Quantum Computation, on some parameter space. We also\nsuggest a possibility that not only usual holonomy but also higher-dimensional\nholonomies must be used to prove a universality of our Holonomic Quantum\nComputation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2001 00:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
