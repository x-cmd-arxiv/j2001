Energy is injected at a few isolated sites\nin space, over relatively small scales, and over short time periods. This leads\nto the coexistence of forced and decaying regimes in the same flow. We find\nthat the ISM-like flow dissipates its turbulent energy rapidly. In simulations\nwith forcing, the input parameters are the radius l_f of the forcing region,\nthe total kinetic energy e_k each source deposits into the flow, and the rate\nof formation of those regions, sfr_OB. The global dissipation time t_d depends\nmainly on l_f.
