We\nfirst show that the no-arbitrage condition imposes that the non-diagonal\nimpacts of any asset i on any other asset j different from i has to vanish on\naverage, i.e., must exhibit random alternative regimes of reinforcement and\ncontrarian feedbacks. In contrast, the diagonal terms must be positive and\nequal on average to the inverse of the discount factor. Applying the results of\nrenewal theory for products of random matrices to stochastic recurrence\nequations (SRE), we extend the theorem of Lux and Sornette (cond-mat/9910141)\nand demonstrate that the tails of the unconditional distributions associated\nwith such d-dimensional bubble processes follow power laws (i.e., exhibit\nhyperbolic decline), with the same asymptotic tail exponent mu<1 for all\nassets. The distribution of price differences and of returns is dominated by\nthe same power-law over an extended range of large returns. This small value\nmu<1 of the tail exponent has far-reaching consequences in the non-existence of\nthe means and variances. Although power-law tails are a pervasive feature of\nempirical data, the numerical value mu<1 is in disagreement with the usual\nempirical estimates mu approximately equal to 3. It, therefore, appears that\ngeneralizing the model of rational bubbles to arbitrary dimensions does not\nallow us to reconcile the model with these stylized facts of financial data.\nThe non-stationary growth rational bubble model seems at present the only\nviable solution (see cond-mat/0010112).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2001 13:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}
