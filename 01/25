To develop the method, we focus on a specific\nstatistical property of the intrinsic Gaussian CMB field; a field point in the\nmap that has a larger absolute value of the temperature threshold tends to have\na larger absolute value of the curvature parameter defined by a trace of second\nderivative matrix of the temperature field, while the ellipticity parameter\nsimilarly defined is uniformly distributed independently of the threshold\nbecause of the isotropic nature of the Gaussian field. The weak lensing then\ncauses a stronger distortion effect on the isotemperature contours with higher\nthreshold and especially induces a coherent distribution of the ellipticity\nparameter correlated with the threshold as a result of the coupling between the\nCMB curvature parameter and the gravitational tidal shear in the observed map.\nThese characteristic patterns can be statistically picked up by considering\nthree independent characteristic functions, which are obtained from the\naverages of quadratic combinations of the second derivative fields of CMB over\nisotemperature contours with each threshold. Consequently, we find that the\nlensing effect generates non-Gaussian signatures on those functions that have a\ndistinct functional dependence of the threshold.
