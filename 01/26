Our inferred rate of shrinkage is about 1.5\nkm/y, which is somewhat smaller than found by Antia et al. We argue that this\nrate does not refer to the surface, but rather to a layer extending roughly\nfrom 4 to 8 Mm beneath the visible surface. The rate of shrinking may be\naccounted for by an increasing radial component of the rms random magnetic\nfield at a rate that depends on its radial distribution. If it were uniform,\nthe required field would be ~7 kG. However, if it were inwardly increasing,\nthen a 1 kG field at 8 Mm would suffice.\n  To assess contribution to the solar radius change arising above 4Mm, we\nanalyzed the p-mode data. The evolution of the p-mode frequencies may be\nexplained by a magnetic^M field growing with activity. The implications of the\nnear-surface magnetic field changes depend on the anisotropy of the random\nmagnetic field. If the field change is predominantly radial, then we infer an\nadditional shrinking at a rate between 1.1-1.3 km/y at the photosphere. If on\nthe other hand the increase is isotropic, we find a competing expansion at a\nrate of 2.3 km/y.

We estimate that the estimated mass loss rates are\ntypically accurate to 50% within the adopted circumstellar model. The physical\nconditions prevailing in the CSEs vary considerably over such a large range of\nmass loss rates. Among other things, it appears that the dust-to-gas mass ratio\nand/or the dust properties change with the mass loss rate. We find that the\nmass loss rate and the gas expansion velocity are well correlated, and that\nboth of them clearly depend on the pulsational period and (with larger scatter)\nthe stellar luminosity. Moreover, the mass loss rate correlates weakly with the\nstellar effective temperature, in the sense that the cooler stars tend to have\nhigher mass loss rates, but there seems to be no correlation with the stellar\nC/O-ratio.

In particular, we consider the Borel transform of the Adler function\nand its expansion around the first infrared renormalon due to the gluon\ncondensate.

When generalized to\ndescribe the fat (rather than infinitely thin) flux-tubes, the pattern of thus\nmodified U(N) Gauge String is proved to be consistent with the chain of the\njudiciously regularized U(N) Loop equations. In particular, we reveal the\ndimensional reduction YM_{D}=>YM_{2}, taking place in the extreme SC limit\n\\lambda=>\\infty, and compare it with the implications of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence conjecture. On the other hand, for the loop-averages associated\nto the sufficiently large minimal areas, the proposed stringy pattern is\nsupposed to be in the one infrared universality class (provided the loops are\nwithout zig-zag backtrackings) with the novel implementation of the noncritical\nD-dimensional Nambu-Goto string. The peculiarity is due to the nonstandard\n\\Lambda^{2}-scaling, \\Lambda^{2}=O(\\sigma_{ph}), of the physical string tension\n\\sigma_{ph}. Being well-motivated from the viewpoint of the standard YM_{4}\ntheory with \\lambda=>0, this scaling is argued to entail that the considered\nmodification of the Nambu-Goto system is in the stringy (rather than in the\nbranched polymer) regime.

It deals either with true tensor\nquantities (when no basis has been introduced) or equivalently with coordinate-\nbased geometric quantities comprising both components and a basis (when some\nbasis has been introduced). It is shown that this invariant formulation, in\nwhich special relativity is understood as the theory of a four-dimensional\nspacetime with the pseudo-Euclidean geometry, completely explains the results\nof the Michelson-Morley experiment. Two noncovariant approaches to the analysis\nof the Michelson-Morley experiment are discussed; the coventional one in which\nonly the path lengths (optical or geometrical) are considered, and Driscoll's\napproach (R.B. Driscoll, Phys. Essays \\QTR{bf}{10,}394 (1997)), in which the\nincrement of phase is determined not only by the segment of geometric path\nlength, but also by the wavelength in that segment. Because these analyses\nbelong to the ''apparent transformations relativity,'' they do not agree with\nthe results of the Michelson-Morley experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2001 15:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The exponential\npropagator and its corresponding effective Hamiltonian are constructed\nexplicitly that describe in quantum mechanics the time evolution of a multi-\nparticle two-state quantum system from the initial state to the output of the\nunsorted quantum search problem. The exponential propagator usually may not be\ncompatible with the mathematical structure and principle of the search problem\nand hence is not a real quantum search network, but it can be further\ndecomposed into a product of a series of the oracle unitary operations such as\nthe selective phase-shift operations and the nonselective unitary operations\nwhich can be expressed further as a sequence of elementary building blocks such\nas one-qubit quantum gates and the two-qubit diagonal phase gates, resulting in\nthat the decomposed propagator is compatible with the mathematical structure\nand principle of the search problem and thus, becomes a real quantum search\nnetwork. The decomposition for the propagator can be achieved with the help of\nthe operator algebra structure and symmetry of the effective Hamiltonian, and\nthe properties of the multiple-quantum operator algebra spaces, especially the\ncharacteristic transformation behavior of the multiple-quantum operators under\nthe z-axis rotations. It has been shown that the computational complexity of\nthe search algorithm is dependent upon that of the numerical multidimensional\nintegration and hence it is believed that the search algorithm could solve\nefficiently the unsorted search problem. An NMR device is also proposed to\nsolve efficiently the unsorted search problem in polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2001 03:33:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2001 03:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
