An intriguing ``very-dense\nspike'' of dark matter has been claimed in models of Gondolo and Silk with\ndensity high enough to contradict with experimental upper bounds of neutralino\nannihilation radiation. This ``spike'' disappears completely or is greatly\nweakened when we include important dynamical processes neglected in their\nidealized/restrictive picture with cold particles surrounding an at-the-center\nzero-seed adiabaticly-growing BH. For the seed BH to spiral in and settle to\nthe center within a Hubble time by dynamical friction, the seed mass must be at\nleast a significant fraction of the present BH. Any subsequent at-the-center\ngrowth of the BH and steepening of the central Keplerian potential well can\nsqueeze the halo density distribution only mildly, whether the squeezing\nhappens adiabatically or instantaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2001 16:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

When the two oscillators are\nanharmonic, the amplitude dependence of their frequencies breaks, in general,\nany initial resonance so that no substantial energy transfer occurs unless an\nalmost perfect resonance persists. This paper considers this interesting\nsituation more generally between two discrete breathers (DBs) belonging to two\nweakly coupled nonlinear systems, finite or infinite. A specific amount of\nenergy injected as a DB in a nonlinear system (donor) which is weakly coupled\nto another nonlinear system (acceptor) sustaining another DB, might be totally\ntransferred and oscillate back and forth between these donor and acceptor DBs.\nThe condition is that a certain well defined detuning function is bounded from\nabove and below by two coupling functions. This targeted energy transfer (TET)\nis selective, i.e., it only occurs for an initial energy close to a specific\nvalue. The calculation of these functions in complex models with numerical\ntechniques developed earlier for DBs, allows one to detect the existence of\npossible TET, between which DBs and at which energy. It should also help for\ndesigning models having desired TET properties. We also show how extra linear\nresonances could make TET incomplete and irreversible. Developments of the\ntheory will be able to describe more spectacular effects, such as TET cascades\nand avalanches, and energy funnels. Besides rather short term applications for\ndevices, this theory might provide an essential clue for understanding puzzling\nproblems of energy kinetics in real materials, chemistry and bioenergetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2001 20:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
