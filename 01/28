The minimum detectable\nfluxes in the 0.5-2 keV and 2-8 keV bands are 1.3e-16 cgs and 6.5e-16 cgs,\nrespectively and a total of 82 sources are detected. More than 80% of the\nextragalactic X-ray background in the 2-8 keV band is resolved. Redshifts are\navailable for 96% of the sources with R<23; the redshift range is 0.1-3.5 with\nmost sources having z < 1.5. Eight of the X-ray sources are located in the\nHDF-N itself, including two not previously reported. A population of X-ray\nfaint, optically bright, nearby galaxies emerges at soft-band fluxes of ~<\n3e-16 cgs.\n  We set the tightest constraints to date on the X-ray emission properties of\nmicroJy radio sources, mid-infrared sources detected by ISO, and very red\n(R-K_s > 5.0) objects. Where both the infrared and the X-ray coverage are\ndeepest, 75% of the X-ray sources are detected by ISO; the high X-ray to\ninfrared matching rate bodes well for future sensitive infrared observations of\nfaint X-ray sources. Four of the 33 very red objects that have been identified\nin the Caltech area by Hogg et al. (2000) are detected in X-rays; these four\nare among our hardest Chandra sources, and we argue that they contain\nmoderately luminous obscured AGN. Overall, however, the small Chandra detection\nfraction suggests a relatively small AGN content in the optically selected very\nred object population.

It is shown that the zero-frequency term of Lifshitz formula has\ninterpretation problem in the case of real metal described by Drude model. It\nhappens because the scattering theory underlying Lifshitz formula is not well\nformulated when the dielectric permittivity takes account of dissipation. To\ngive the zeroth term of Lifshitz formula the definite meaning different\nprescriptions were used recently by different authors with diversed results.\nThese results are shown to be improper and in disagreement with experiment and\nthe general physical requirements. We propose the new prescription which is a\ngeneralization of Schwinger, DeRaad and Milton recipe formulated earlier for\nideal metals. On this base the detailed numerical and analytical computations\nof the temperature Casimir force are performed in configuration of two plane\nplates and a spherical lens (sphere) above a plate. The corrections due to\nnonzero temperature and finite conductivity found in the paper are in agreement\nwith the limiting case of perfect metal and fit all experimental and\ntheoretical requirements. Among other facts, the previous results obtained in\nframes of plasma model are confirmed. It appears they are the limiting case of\nDrude model computations when the relaxation parameter goes to zero. The\ncomparison with the Casimir force acting between dielectric test bodies is\nmade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2001 17:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2001 12:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In this\npaper we show how the resulting \"mysteries\" of usual theory are solved within\nthe unreduced, dynamically multivalued description of the underlying,\nessentially nonlinear interaction process (quant-ph/9902015, quant-ph/9902016),\nwithout artificial modification of the Schroedinger equation. The latter is\nrigorously derived instead as universal expression of unreduced interaction\ncomplexity. Causal, totally realistic wavefunction is obtained as a dynamically\nprobabilistic intermediate state of a simple system with interaction performing\ndynamically discrete transitions between its localised, incompatible\n\"realisations\" (\"corpuscular\" states). Causal wavefunction and Schroedinger\nequation are then extended to arbitrary level of world dynamics. We outline\nsome applications of the obtained causal description, such as genuine quantum\nchaos (quant-ph/9511034-36) and realistic quantum devices (physics/0211071),\nand emphasize the basic difference of the proposed dynamically multivalued\ntheory from dynamically single-valued imitations of causality and complexity.\nThe causally complete wavefunction concept, representing the unified essence of\nunreduced (multivalued) complex dynamics, provides a clear distinctive feature\nof realistic science, absent in any its unitary imitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2001 22:58:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2001 17:25:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2006 10:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
