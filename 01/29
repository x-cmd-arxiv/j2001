When the closed vector density is\nassigned the role of an intrinsic charge current density, and the components of\nthe normal field are assigned the roles of the electromagnetic potentials, the\ntheory is formally equivalent to an exterior differential system that generates\nthe PDE's of both the Maxwell Faraday equations and the Maxwell Ampere\nequations.

Some modification of the standard minimal substraction\nscheme has been used to analyze stability of the Kolmogorov scaling regime\nwhich is governed by the renormalization group fixed point. This fixed point is\nunstable at $d=2$; thus, the infinitesimally weak anisotropy destroyes above\nscaling regime in two-dimensional space. The restoration of the stability of\nthis fixed point, under transition from $d=2$ to $d=3,$ has been demonstrated\nat borderline dimension $ 2<d_c<3$. The results are in qualitative agreement\nwith ones obtained recently in the framework of the usual analytical\nregularization scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2001 10:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
