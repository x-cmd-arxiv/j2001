One of the observational tests of the WDM model is to measure the\ngravitationally lensed images of distant quasars below sub-arcsecond scales. In\nthis Letter, we report a comparison of the lensing probabilities of multiple\nimages between CDM and WDM models using a singular isothermal sphere model for\nthe mass density profiles of dark halos and the Press-Schechter mass function\nfor their distribution and cosmic evolution. It is shown that the differential\nprobability of multiple images with small angular separations down to 10\nmilliarcseconds should allow one to set useful constraints on the WDM particle\nmass.

One can then suppress the thermal noise by\noptimally subtracting the recorded fiber motions from the measured motion of\nthe test mass, i.e., from the LIGO output. The proposed method is a\nmodification of an analogous but more technically difficult scheme by\nBraginsky, Levin and Vyatchanin for reducing broad-band suspension thermal\nnoise. The efficiency of our method is limited by the sensitivity of the sensor\nused to monitor the fiber motion.

According to\nthe informal description given by the physicists, it is a probability measure\non the space of connections modulo gauge transformations on a principal bundle\nwith compact structure group. We are interested in the case where the base\nspace of this bundle is a compact orientable surface.\n  The construction of the measure in a discrete setting, where the base space\nof the fiber bundle is replaced by a graph traced on a surface, is quite well\nunderstood thanks to the work of E. Witten. In contrast, the continuum limit of\nthis construction, which should allow to put a genuine manifold as base space,\nstill remains problematic.\n  This work presents a complete and unified approach of the discrete theory and\nof its continuum limit. We give a geometrically consistent definition of the\nYang-Mills measure, under the form of a random holonomy along a wide, intrinsic\nand natural class of loops. This definition allows us to study combinatorial\nproperties of the measure, like its Markovian behaviour under the surgery of\nsurfaces, as well as properties specific to the continuous setting, for\nexample, some of its microscopic properties.

However, it is possible to determine the asymptotic\ntime, i.e., the time the particle spends in a large area including the barrier.\nWe propose a model of time measurements. The model provides a procedure for\ncalculation of the asymptotic tunneling and reflection times. The model also\ndemonstrates the impossibility of determination of the time the tunneling\nparticle spends under the barrier. Examples for delta-form and rectangular\nbarrier illustrate the obtained results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2001 10:10:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Collective operators are conveniently used\nto account for permutation symmetry: The respective Hilbert-space dimension is\nthen only polynomial in N and governed by strong selection rules. These\nselection rules can be exploited for the design of decoherence-free subspaces\nas well as for the implementation of efficient routes to entanglement if\nsuspended switching between states of different symmetry classes could be\nrealized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2001 11:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
