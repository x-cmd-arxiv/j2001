We first calculate the source\ncounts from 350 um to 3 mm using the empirical infrared galaxy number count\nmodel of Takeuchi et al. (2001). Based on the number counts, we evaluate the\nsource confusion and determine the confusion limit at various wavebands as a\nfunction of the characteristic beam size. At submillimeter wavelengths, source\nconfusion with the 10-15-m class facilities becomes severe at 0.1 to 1 mJy\nlevel, and astrometry and flux measurements will be difficult. However, we show\nthat very a large-area survey of submillimeter sources brighter than 10-50 mJy\ncan provide a unique constraint on infrared galaxy evolution at z = 1-2. We\nalso find that the 5\\sigma-confusion limit of the LMSA is fainter than 1 \\mu\nJy. The source counts at such faint flux levels give important information of\nthe epoch of galaxy formation.

We present a principle that gives a\ndefinite distinction between the operations that preserve the states of the\nsystem and those that disturb the states. The principle is derived by\nalternately applying a fundamental property of classical signals and a\nfundamental property of quantum ones. The principle can be cast into a simple\nform by using a decomposition of the relevant Hilbert space, which is uniquely\ndetermined by the set of possible states. The decomposition implies the\nclassification of the degrees of freedom of the system into three parts\ndepending on how they store the information on the initially chosen state: one\nstoring it classically, one storing it nonclassically, and the other one\nstoring no information. Then the principle states that the nonclassical part is\ninaccessible and the classical part is read-only if we are to preserve the\nstate of the system. From this principle, many types of no-cloning,\nno-broadcasting, and no-imprinting conditions can easily be derived in general\nforms including mixed states. It also gives a unified view on how various\nschemes of quantum cryptography work.
