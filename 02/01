Our\nK band data significantly complement the optical photometry and spectroscopy in\nthe literature: K band data are fundamental to study the Asymptotic Giant\nBranch (AGB) population of these clusters, since the AGB phase transition\n(occuring between the age of 200 Myr and 1 Gyr) causes abrupt changes in the\nnear-infrared luminosity of the clusters while producing only small changes in\nthe optical. Therefore, the e.g. V-K colour is ideal to study this evolutionary\nphase of stellar populations. For the present analysis we present models for\nSimple Stellar Populations which include the contribution of the AGB stellar\nphase, calibrated with the young and intermediate age star clusters of the\nMagellanic Clouds. The comparison with the colour distribution of the NGC 7252\nstar clusters shows that they are indeed intermediate age clusters undergoing\nthe AGB phase transition. The AGB phase transition is observed for the first\ntime outside the Local Group. Most of the studied clusters span the very narrow\nage range 300-500 Myr, and likely have metallicities 0.5-1 Z_{\\odot}. A very\nimportant exception is the cluster W32, which has already completed its AGB\nepoch, its colours being consistent with an age of 1-2 Gyr. This impacts on the\nduration of the merger-induced starburst.

Near the peak of the\nmicrolensing event, the outer edge of the image is more highly magnified than\nits central region, whereas the situation is reversed at later times due to the\nrapid radial expansion of the image on the sky. Thus, the microlensed afterglow\nlight curve can be inverted to recover the self-similar radial intensity\nprofile of the afterglow image. We calculate the expected errors in the\nrecovered intensity profile as a function of the number of resolution elements,\nunder the assumption that the afterglow and microlensing event parameters are\nknown. For a point-mass lens and uniform source, we derive a simple scaling\nrelation between these parameters and the resultant errors. The afterglow need\nnot be monitored for its entire duration; rather, observations from the peak\nmagnification time t_p of the microlensing event until 7 t_p are sufficient to\nresolve the majority of the image. Thus, microlensing events can be alerted by\nrelatively infrequent observations of afterglows and then monitored\nintensively, without significant loss of information about the afterglow\nintensity profile. The relative intensity profile of about 1% of all afterglows\ncan be measured with 10 resolution elements to an accuracy of 1% in the optical\nand 10% in the infrared, using 4m-class telescopes.

Current analyses lead to gas\nfractions at virial radius which are typically of the order of\n0.20$h^{-3/2}_{50}$, favoring a low density universe. In this work, we examine\ncritically this issue through the analysis of the baryon distribution in\nclusters. We find that the currently derived gas fraction profile, increases\nregularly from the inner part to the outer part, up to the virial radius, and\nbeyond. Such a shape contrasts with what is expected from numerical\nhydro-dynamical simulations, in which the gas fraction is more or less constant\nin the outer region, reaching a plateau when the contrast density falls off\nbelow $10^4$. We argue that such a difference is hardly explained by reheating\neffects, while taking into account various factors entering into the\ndetermination of clusters gas fraction may erase such a difference. Indeed,\nusing recent estimates on gas content in the outer part of clusters (Vikhlinin\net al., 1999) and applying the correction factor due to the effect of gas\nclumping, we find that the gas fraction shape over the range $ 200< \\delta<\n10^5$ is roughly consistent with hydro-dynamical simulations for an universal\ngas fraction in the range 8-11% (for $h_{50} =1.$), the mass estimators being\ncalibrated from numerical simulations. In contrast, values of the order of 20%\ndo not give acceptable fit to the data on any scale.

This quantum property is incompatible with\nthe separation of a single system into two uncorrelated subsystems.\nConsequently, it does not require the use of an additive form of entropy. We\ndiscuss the problem of the choice of the most convenient entropy indicator,\nfocusing our attention on a system of 2 qubits, and on a special set, denoted\nby $\\Im$. This set contains both the maximally and the partially entangled\nstates that are described by density matrices diagonal in the Bell basis set.\nWe select this set for the main purpose of making more straightforward our work\nof analysis. As a matter of fact, we find that in general the conventional von\nNeumann entropy is not a monotonic function of the entanglement strength. This\nmeans that the von Neumann entropy is not a reliable indicator of the departure\nfrom the condition of maximum entanglement. We study the behavior of a form of\nnon-additive entropy, made popular by the 1988 work by Tsallis. We show that in\nthe set $\\Im$, implying the key condition of non-vanishing entanglement, this\nnon-additive entropy indicator turns out to be a strictly monotonic function of\nthe strength of the entanglement, if entropy indexes $q$ larger than a critical\nvalue $Q$ are adopted. We argue that this might be a consequence of the\nnon-additive nature of the Tsallis entropy, implying that the world is quantum\nand that uncorrelated subsystems do not exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2001 22:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The existence of potentials, A, leads to the independent\n3-forms of T-Torsion = A^F and T-Spin = A^G. The exterior derivatives\n(divergences) of these 3-forms produce anomalies that define the two classic\nPoincare invariants. The closed integrals of these forms, when deformation\ninvariants of frozen-in fields, define topological coherent structures in the\nplasma. Solutions when T-Torsion (T-Spin) is zero define transverse magnetic\n(electric) modes on topological grounds. When the divergence of T-Torsion is\nnot zero there exists a classical mechanism for charge acceleration along the\nmagnetic field lines producing symplectic plasma currents; large temperature\ngradients along the B field lines can act as a source of stellar plasma jets in\nneutron stars. In such circumstances, the Torsion vector is uniquely defined by\nconformal invariance of the Action potentials. Plasma currents in the direction\nof the Torsion vector leave both A^F and A^G conformally invariant, hence these\nfields are frozen-in even though the processes are thermodynamically\nirreversible. The decaying coherent and deformable topological structures\nassociated with such frozen-in fields are persistent and observable artifacts,\nsimilar to wakes, that can appear in any plasma domain, such as that which\nsurrounds stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2001 07:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
