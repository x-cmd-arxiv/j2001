We\nfind that the presence of the tail can significantly increase the net (after\naccounting for self-absorption) cyclo-synchrotron emission of the plasma, which\nemission then provides seed photons for Compton upscattering. Thus, the\nluminosity in the thermally-Comptonized spectrum is enhanced as well. The\nimportance of these effects increases with both increasing Eddington ratio and\nthe black hole mass. The enhancement of the Comptonized synchrotron luminosity\ncan be as large as by factors of $\\sim 10^3$ and $\\sim 10^5$ for stellar and\nsupermassive black holes, respectively, when the energy content in the\nnon-thermal tail is 1 per cent.\n  The presence of the tail only weakly hardens the thermal Comptonization\nspectrum but it leads to formation of a high-energy tail beyond the thermal\ncut-off, which two effects are independent of the nature of the seed photons.\nSince observations of high-energy tails in Comptonization spectra can constrain\nthe non-thermal tails in the electron distribution and thus the Comptonized\nsynchrotron luminosity, they provide upper limits on the strength of magnetic\nfields in accretion flows. In particular, the measurement of an MeV tail in the\nhard state of Cyg X-1 by McConnell et al. implies the magnetic field strength\nin this source to be at most an order of magnitude below equipartition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2001 12:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The total features were well expressed by the Coffey-Clem\nmodel. From the data, we estimated the viscosity and pinning frequency, which\nwere found to be independent of frequency. In particular, the obtained\nviscosity definitely shows that the core of vortex of YBa2Cu3Oy is moderately\nclean. This result suggests that new physics will show up, for the physics of\nquantum moderately clean vortex core is unknown at all. (2) An anomaly found in\nthe surface reactance at the first order transition (FOT) of vortex lattice was\ninvestigated in Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy with various doping levels. As a result, the\nanomaly was found only in the samples exhibiting the FOT. On the other hand, we\ndid not observe the anomaly in YBa2Cu3Oy. These suggest that the anomaly is due\nto the change in the electronic states of the vortices characteristic of\nmaterials with very strong anisotropy. (3) We measured H dependence of both the\nthermal conductivity \\kappa(H) and Zs(H) in exactly the same pieces of crystal.\nWe could not find any anomaly in Zs(H) even at the onset of the plateau. This\nresult suggests that the origin of the plateau in \\kappa(H) is not a drastic\nphase transition but is rather gradual crossover.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2001 21:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Revised version","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  A quantum gravity-gradiometer consists of two spatially separated ensembles\nof atoms interrogated by pulses of a common laser beam. Laser pulses cause the\nprobability amplitudes of atomic ground-state hyperfine levels to interfere,\nproducing two motion-sensitive phase shifts which allow the measurement of the\naverage acceleration of each ensemble, and, via simple differencing, of the\nacceleration gradient. Here I propose entangling the quantum states of the two\nensembles prior to the pulse sequence, and show that entanglement encodes their\nrelative acceleration in a single interference phase which can be measured\ndirectly, with no need for differencing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2001 21:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2002 20:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
