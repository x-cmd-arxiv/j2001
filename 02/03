We find that less than 10% of the stellar population\noriginates from star forming regions destined to become open clusters,\nconfirming earlier estimates. The smallest clusters included in the\nobservational surveys (having at least N=100 members) roughly coincide with the\nsmallest stellar systems that are expected to evolve as clusters in a dynamical\nsense. We show that stellar systems with too few members N < N_\\star have\ndynamical relaxation times that are shorter than their formation times (1-2\nMyr), where the critical number of stars N_\\star \\approx 100. Our results\nsuggest that star formation can be characterized by (at least) three principal\nmodes: I. isolated singles and binaries, II. groups (N<N_\\star), and III.\nclusters (N>N_\\star). Many -- if not most -- stars form through the\nintermediate mode in stellar groups with 10<N<100. Such groups evolve and\ndisperse much more rapidly than open clusters; groups also have a low\nprobability of containing massive stars and are unaffected by supernovae and\nintense ultraviolet radiation fields.

This was soon\nrelated to the so called McKay correspondence in mathematics (cf. [McK]). Later\ndevelopments include stringy Hodge numbers (cf. [Z], [BD]), mirror symmetry of\nCalabi-Yau orbifolds (cf. [Ro]), and most recently the Gromov-Witten invariants\nof symplectic orbifolds (cf. [CR1-2]). One common feature of these studies is\nthat certain contributions from singularities, which are called ``twisted\nsectors'' in physics, have to be properly incorporated. This is called the\n``stringy aspect'' of an orbifold (cf. [R]).\n  This paper makes an effort to understand the stringy aspect of orbifolds in\nthe realm of ``traditional mathematics''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2001 20:11:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2001 18:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 May 2001 18:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The associated Cartan topology permits the definition of four\nbasic topological equivalence classes of flows based on the Pfaff dimension of\nthe 1-form of Action. Potential flows or streamline processes are generated by\nan Action 1-form of Pfaff dimension 1 and 2, respectively. Chaotic flows must\nbe associated with domains of Pfaff dimension 3 or more. Turbulent flows are\nassociated with domains of Pfaff dimension 4. It will be demonstrated that the\nNavier-Stokes equations are related to Action 1-forms of Pfaff dimension 4. The\nCartan Topology is a disconnected topology if the Pfaff dimension is greater\nthan 2. This fact implies that the creation of turbulence (a state of Pfaff\ndimension 4 and a disconnected Cartan topology) from a streamline flow (a state\nof Pfaff dimension 2 and a connected topology) can take place only by\ndiscontinuous processes which induce shocks and tangential discontinuities. On\nthe otherhand, the decay of turbulence can be described by continuous, but\nirreversible, processes. Numerical procedures that force continuity of slope\nand value cannot in principle describe the creation of turbulence, but such\ntechniques of forced continuity can be used to describe the decay of\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2001 20:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
