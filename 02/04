The\nproblem consists of estimating the population vector x, composed by the\ncontributions of n_star base elements to the integrated spectrum of a galaxy,\nand the extinction A_V, given a set of absorption line equivalent widths and\ncontinuum colors. The formalism is applied to the n_star = 12 base defined by\nSchmidt etal and subsequently used in several studies. The 13-D parameter space\nis explored with a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme based on the\nMetropolis algorithm, which produces a smooth and efficient mapping of the\nP(x,A_V) probability distribution.\n  This version of Empirical Population Synthesis is used to investigate the\nability to recover the detailed history of star-formation and chemical\nevolution using this spectral base. This is studied as a function of (1) the\nmagnitude of the measurement errors and (2) the set of observables used in the\nsynthesis. Only for extremely high S/N all 12 base proportions can be\naccurately recovered, though the observables are very precisely reproduced for\nany S/N. Furthermore, the individual mean x components are biased in the sense\nthat components which carry a large fraction of the light tend to share their\ncontribution preferably among components of same age. This compensation effect\nis linked to noise-induced linear dependences in the base, which very\neffectively redistribute the likelihood in x-space. The age distribution,\nhowever, can be satisfactorily recovered for realistic data quality.

A unit that has always\nsimilar or identical structure or form, despite even complex operations such as\nintegration and derivation, is the ideal unit for the new sciences of\ncomplexity or just the systems sciences where structure or form, wholeness,\norganization, and complexity are main requirements.

Auditory responses to radar, called microwave\nhearing, have been the best known of these phenomena. To account for microwave\nhearing, many studies in the literature have adopted a rate-of-heating\nhypothesis advanced by Foster and Finch in 1974. We show here that theoretical\nand experimental studies supporting this hypothesis are weaker than usually\nassumed.\n  We develop a simple framework of understanding of EMR that may be used to\nexplain microwave hearing as a nonthermal, nonacoustic effect. We then extend\nthis approach to other contexts, pointing out several fundamental\nmisconceptions confounding the field.\n  EMR, especially wide-band EMR, primarily must have a nonthermal effect on\nliving tissue before conversion to heat. Auditory and tactile sensations,\ncentral neurological disability, and blood pressure loss caused by EMR have\nbeen documented. Except microwave hearing, parameters of irradiation causing\nsuch effects have not been explored adequately and remain unknown. There\nappears not to be any forensic methodology to prove the cause of harm at\nnonthermal levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2001 06:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Sun, 4 May 2014 05:54:51 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 22:33:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Feb 2001 05:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2001 00:32:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 May 2001 06:06:37 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2001 05:21:02 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2001 00:56:37 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2002 05:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 15 May 2002 06:06:25 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2009 05:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-30"}

The covariant generalization\nof Moyal theory, also known as Vey quantum mechanics, was presented in the\nliterature many years ago. However, a derivation of the formalism directly from\nstandard operator quantum mechanics, clarifying the relation between the two\nformulations is still missing. In this paper we present a covariant\ngeneralization of the Weyl order prescription and of the Weyl-Wigner map and\nuse them to derive Vey quantum mechanics directly from the standard operator\nformulation. The procedure displays some interesting features: it yields all\nthe key ingredients and provides a more straightforward interpretation of the\nVey theory including a direct implementation of unitary operator\ntransformations as phase space coordinate transformations in the Vey idiom.\nThese features are illustrated through a simple example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Feb 2001 19:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
