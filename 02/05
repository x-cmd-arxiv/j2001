In all three\nsources, the disk color temperature was uncomfortably high at T_{in}=1.0-2.0\nkeV, and was found to vary in proportion to the square-root of the source flux.\nThe apparent accretion-disk radius is hence inferred to change as inversely\nproportional to T_{in}. This suggests a significant effect of advection in the\naccretion disk. However, even taking this effect fully into account, the too\nhigh values of T_{in} of ULXs cannot be explained.

This paper presents a study of the L^2 metric\ngamma on M_n, the space of degree n harmonic maps S^2 -> S^2, or equivalently,\nthe space of rational maps of degree n. It is proved that gamma is Kaehler with\nrespect to a certain natural complex structure on M_n. The case n=1 is\nconsidered in detail: explicit formulae for gamma and its holomorphic\nsectional, Ricci and scalar curvatures are obtained, it is shown that the space\nhas finite volume and diameter and codimension 2 boundary at infinity, and a\ncertain class of Hamiltonian flows on M_1 is analyzed. It is proved that\n\\tilde{M}_n, the space of absolute degree n (an odd positive integer) harmonic\nmaps RP^2 -> RP^2, is a totally geodesic Lagrangian submanifold of M_n, and\nthat for all n>1, \\tilde{M}_n is geodesically incomplete.

We first introduce an\nintegrated formalism of evolutionary search which provides a unified view on\ndifferent specific approaches. On this basis we discuss the implications of\nindirect modeling (via a ``genotype-phenotype mapping'') on the exploration\nstrategy. Notions such as modularity, pleiotropy and functional phenotypic\ncomplex are discussed as implications. Then, rigorously reflecting the notion\nof self-adaptability, we introduce a new definition that captures\nself-adaptability of exploration: different genotypes that map to the same\nphenotype may represent (also topologically) different exploration strategies;\nself-adaptability requires a variation of exploration strategies along such a\n``neutral space''. By this definition, the concept of neutrality becomes a\ncentral concern of this paper. Finally, we present examples of these concepts:\nFor a specific grammar-type encoding, we observe a large variability of\nexploration strategies for a fixed phenotype, and a self-adaptive drift towards\nshort representations with highly structured exploration strategy that matches\nthe ``problem's structure''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2001 13:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
