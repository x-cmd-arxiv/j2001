A spatially resolved spectral\nanalysis with a resolution of 8\\arcsec has yielded a precise determination of\nthe relation between the spectral index and the distance from the center. We do\nnot see any evidence for bright thermal emission from the central core. In\ncontrast with previous ASCA and {\\em Einstein} results, we derive an upper\nlimit to the black-body 0.5-10 keV luminosity and emitting area of $1.8\\times\n10^{32}$ \\ergsec and $1.3\\times 10^{10}$ cm$^2$, respectively, ruling out\nemission from the hot surface of the putative neutron star and also excluding\nthe \"outer-gap\" model for hot polar caps. We have performed for the first time\na spectral analysis of the outer regions of the X-ray nebula, where most of the\nemission is still non-thermal, but where the addition of a soft (kT=0.2-0.3\nkeV) optically thin plasma component is required to fit the spectrum at $E<1$\nkeV. This component provides 6% of the whole remnant observed flux in the\n0.5-10.0 keV band. We show that a Sedov interpretation is incompatible with the\nSN1181-3C58 association, unless there is a strong deviation from electron-ion\nenergy equipartition, and that an origin of this thermal emission in terms of\nthe expansion of the nebula into the ejecta core nicely fits all the radio and\nX-ray observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2001 11:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Firstly, we recall that, in a\nfrustrated system, the effective average interaction between two spins may take\ndifferent values (possibly with opposite signs) at different temperatures. We\ngive simple examples of such situations, which we compute exactly. Such\nmechanisms can explain why new ordering processes (rejuvenation) seem to take\nplace in spin glasses when the temperature is lowered. Secondly, we emphasize\nthe fact that inhomogeneous interactions do naturally lead to a wide\ndistribution of relaxation times for thermally activated flips. `Memory spots'\nspontaneously appear, in the sense that the flipping time of some spin clusters\nbecomes extremely long when the temperature is decreased. Such memory spots are\ncapable of keeping the memory of previous ordering at a higher temperature\nwhile new ordering processes occur at a lower temperature.

In this note we discuss this relationship further and\npoint out its possible applications to cuprates and related materials. The\nconnection between quantum groups and strings is one way of seeing the validity\nof our previous conjecture [i.e. that a theory for cuprates may be constructed\non the basis of quantum groups]. The cuprates seems to exhibit statistics,\ndimensionality and phase transitions in novel ways. The nature of excitations\n[i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must be understood. The Hubbard model\ncaptures some of the behaviour of the phase transitions in these materials. On\nthe other hand the phases such as stripes in these materials bear relationship\nto quantum group or string-like solutions. One thus expects that the relevant\nsolutions of Hubbard model may thus be written in terms of stringy solutions.\nIn short this approach may lead to the non-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard\nand other condensed matter Hamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d\nbased symmetry such as quantum groups can be relevant in describing a 3-d\n[spatial dimensions] system such as cuprates. The answer lies in the key\nobservation that strings which are 1-d objects can be used to describe physics\nin $d$ dimensions. For example gravity [which is a 3-d [spatial] plus time]\nphenomenon can be understood in terms of 1-d strings.
