It underwent a bright optical\noutburst on 1999 Sept. 15.7 UT, going from magnitude 14 to 8.8 in the V-band\n(Stubbings 1999), and reaching 12.2 Crab in the X-rays (Smith et al. 1999) and\nKs nearly 13.

The\npurpose of this article is to introduce and study a new notion of algebra,\ncalled \"associative dialgebra\", which is, to the Leibniz algebras, what\nassociative algebras are to Lie algebras. An associative dialgebra is a vector\nspace equipped with two associative operations satisfying three more\nconditions. For instance, any differential associative algebra gives rise to a\ndialgebra.\n  In this article we construct and study a (co)homology theory for associative\ndialgebras. The surprizing fact, in the construction of the chain complex, is\nthe appearance of the combinatorics of planar binary trees (grafting and\nnesting). The principal result about this homology theory is its vanishing on\nfree associative dialgebras.\n  The Koszul dual (in the sense of Ginzburg and Kapranov) of the operad of\nassociative dialgebras is the operad of \"dendriform algebras\". The dendriform\nalgebras are characterized by two operations satisfying three linear\nconditions. The sum of these two operations defines a new operation which is\nassociative. The free dendriform algebra can be described in terms of planar\nbinary trees. As a consequence we give an explicitly description of strong\nhomotopy associative dialgebras.\n  This paper is part of a long-standing project whose ultimate aim is to study\nperiodicity phenomenons in algebraic K-theory, as explained in ``Overview on\nLeibniz algebras, dialgebras and their homology\".

Nevertheless, already this\nsimple regime reveals peculiar differences between the behaviour of finite-size\nand that of infinitesimal perturbations. A mean-field analysis of the truly\nspatially extended case clarifies that the onset of chaotic behaviour can be\ntraced back to the diffusion process that tends to shift the growth rate of\nfinite perturbations from the quenched to the annealed average. The possible\ncharacterization of the transition as the onset of directed percolation is also\nbriefly discussed as well as the connections with a synchronization transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2001 00:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
