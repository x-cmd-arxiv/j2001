We identify two generations of halos: those\nwith low virial temperatures, Tvir < 9000 K that remain largely neutral, and\nthose with larger virial temperatures that become ionized. The\nlower-temperature, lower-mass halos are the first to cool to 75 percent of\ntheir virial temperature. The precise temperature and mass of the first objects\nare dependent upon the molecular hydrogen (H2) cooling function and the\ncosmological model. The higher-mass halos collapse later but, in this paradigm,\ncool much more efficiently once they have done so, first via electronic\ntransitions and then via molecular cooling: in fact, a greater residual\nionization once the halos cool below 9000 K results in an enhanced H2\nproduction and hence a higher cooling rate at low temperatures than for the\nlower-mass halos, so that within our constant-density model it is the former\nthat are the first to cool to really low temperatures. We discuss the possible\nsignificance of this result in the context of CDM models in which the shallow\nslope of the initial fluctuation spectrum on small scales leads to a wide range\nof halo masses (of differing overdensities) collapsing over a small redshift\ninterval. This ``crosstalk'' is sufficiently important that both high- and\nlow-mass halos collapse during the lifetimes of the massive stars which may be\nformed at these epochs.

If Earth's orbit migrates outward, however, the biosphere\ncould remain intact over the entire main-sequence lifetime of the Sun. In this\npaper, we explore the feasibility of engineering such a migration over a long\ntime period. The basic mechanism uses gravitational assists to (in effect)\ntransfer orbital energy from Jupiter to the Earth, and thereby enlarges the\norbital radius of Earth. This transfer is accomplished by a suitable\nintermediate body, either a Kuiper Belt object or a main belt asteroid. The\nobject first encounters Earth during an inward pass on its initial highly\nelliptical orbit of large (~ 300 AU) semimajor axis. The encounter transfers\nenergy from the object to the Earth in standard gravity-assist fashion by\npassing close to the leading limb of the planet. The resulting outbound\ntrajectory of the object must cross the orbit of Jupiter; with proper timing,\nthe outbound object encounters Jupiter and picks up the energy it lost to\nEarth. With small corrections to the trajectory, or additional planetary\nencounters (e.g., with Saturn), the object can repeat this process over many\nencounters. To maintain its present flux of solar energy, the Earth must\nexperience roughly one encounter every 6000 years (for an object mass of 1E22\ng). We develop the details of this scheme and discuss its ramifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2001 22:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-02"}

We show that the\nluminosity profile computed with bright galaxies is significantly cusped in the\ncenter of the clusters, whatever the redshift. This is in agreement with the\ndark matter profiles predicted by numerical simulations. The galaxy number\ndensity profile for the bright galaxies is fitted equally well with a core\nmodel or a cusped model. In contrast, the luminosity and the galaxy number\ndensity profiles of the fainter galaxies are significantly better fitted by a\ncore rather than a cusp model. We did not detect any statistically significant\ndifferent fits when applied to data in range from z=0 to z=0.5. The difference\nin profile between faint and bright galaxies may be due to the rapid (relative\nto the age of the universe at z=0 versus z=0.5) destruction of the faint\ngalaxies by tidal forces and merging events in the denser central regions of\nthe clusters. This process could erase the cusp by turning faint galaxies into\ndiffuse light. In this case, the galaxies (with a cusp visible in the bright\ngalaxy number density and mainly in luminosity profiles) would trace the total\nmass distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2001 10:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The present model takes\ninto account in more detail than previously the halo density distribution and\nexplores the effects of a threshold density in the star formation process,\nduring both the halo and disk phases. In the comparison between model\npredictions and available data, we have focused our attention on abundance\ngradients as well as gas, stellar and star formation rate distributions along\nthe disk. We suggest that the mechanism for the formation of the halo leaves\ndetectable imprints on the chemical properties of the outer regions of the\ndisk, whereas the evolution of the halo and the inner disk are almost\ncompletely disentangled. This is due to the fact that the halo and disk\ndensities are comparable at large Galactocentric distances and therefore the\ngas lost from the halo can substantially contribute to building up the outer\ndisk. We also show that the existence of a threshold density for the star\nformation rate, both in the halo and disk phase, is necessary to reproduce the\nmajority of observational data in the solar vicinity and in the whole disk.\nMoreover, we predict that the abundance gradients along the Galactic disk must\nhave increased with time and that the average [alpha/Fe] ratio in stars (halo\nplus disk) slightly decrease going from 4 to 10 Kpcs from the Galactic center.\nWe also show that the same ratios increase substantially towards the outermost\ndisk regions and the expected scatter in the stellar ages decreases, because\nthe outermost regions are dominated by halo stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2001 11:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We discuss the nature of the\ntransitions among these states and evaluate some of the critical exponents.\nFurther, we determine accurately the position of the multi-critical point,\n(U_m,V_m)= (4.7 +/- 0.1, 2.51 +/- 0.04) (in energy units where the hopping\nintegral is normalized to unity), above which the two continuous SDW-BOW-CDW\ntransitions are replaced by one discontinuous (first-order) direct SDW-CDW\ntransition. We also discuss the evolution of the CDW and BOW states upon hole\ndoping. We find that in both cases the ground state is a Luther-Emery liquid,\ni.e., the spin gap remains but the charge gap existing at half-filling is\nimmediately closed upon doping. The charge and bond-order correlations decay\nwith distance r as r^{-K_rho}, where K_rho is approximately 0.5 for the\nparameters we have considered. We also discuss advantages of using parallel\ntempering (or exchange Monte Carlo) -- an extended ensemble method that we here\ncombine with quantum Monte Carlo -- in studies of quantum phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2001 21:29:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2002 17:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The spontaneous Hall effect in a chiral superconductor is, however,\nnon-universal. Our analysis is based on three approaches to the problem: a\nself-consistent solution of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, a generalized\nGinzburg-Landau theory, and a hydrodynamic formulation. All three methods\nconsistently lead to the same conclusion that the spontaneous Hall resistance\nof a two-dimensional superconducting Hall bar is of order h/(e k_F\\lambda)^2,\nwhere k_F is the Fermi wave vector and \\lambda is the London penetration depth;\nthe Hall resistance is substantially suppressed from a quantum unit of\nresistance.

A bipartite superoperator is said to be localizable if it can be\nimplemented by two parties (Alice and Bob) who share entanglement but do not\ncommunicate; it is causal if the superoperator does not convey information from\nAlice to Bob or from Bob to Alice. We characterize the general structure of\ncausal complete measurement superoperators, and exhibit examples that are\ncausal but not localizable. We construct another class of causal bipartite\nsuperoperators that are not localizable by invoking bounds on the strength of\ncorrelations among the parts of a quantum system. A bipartite superoperator is\nsaid to be semilocalizable if it can be implemented with one-way quantum\ncommunication from Alice to Bob, and it is semicausal if it conveys no\ninformation from Bob to Alice. We show that all semicausal complete measurement\nsuperoperators are semilocalizable, and we establish a general criterion for\nsemicausality. In the multipartite case, we observe that a measurement\nsuperoperator that projects onto the eigenspaces of a stabilizer code is\nlocalizable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2001 05:10:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2001 21:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
