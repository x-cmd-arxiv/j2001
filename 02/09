The low-energy behavior of\nnon-interacting fermions which are subject to a static random backscattering\npotential will be described by the fluctuating gap model (FGM). Recently, the\nFGM has also been used to explain the pseudogap phenomenon in high-$T_c$\nsuperconductors. After an elementary introduction to the FGM in the context of\ncommensurate and incommensurate Peierls chains, we develop a non-perturbative\nmethod which allows for a simultaneous calculation of the density of states\n(DOS) and the inverse localization length. First, we recover all known results\nin the limits of zero and infinite correlation lengths of the random potential.\nThen, we attack the problem of finite correlation lengths. While a complex\norder parameter, which describes incommensurate Peierls chains, leads to a\nsuppression of the DOS, i.e. a pseudogap, the DOS exhibits a singularity at the\nFermi energy if the order parameter is real and therefore refers to a\ncommensurate system. We confirm these results by calculating the DOS and the\ninverse localization length for finite correlation lengths and Gaussian\nstatistics of the backscattering potential with unprecedented accuracy\nnumerically. Finally, we consider the case of classical phase fluctuations\nwhich apply to low temperatures where amplitude fluctuations are frozen out. In\nthis physically important regime, which is also characterized by finite\ncorrelation lengths, we present analytic results for the DOS, the inverse\nlocalization length, the specific heat, and the Pauli susceptibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2001 19:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

The higher\ndimensional theory is supersymmetric, and hence requires the top-quark Yukawa\ncoupling to be localized on some ``Yukawa brane'' in the bulk. The short\ndistance divergence in the Higgs-boson mass is regulated because supersymmetry\nis unbroken in the vicinity of this Yukawa brane. A finite, negative Higgs\nmass-squared is generated radiatively by the top-quark supermultiplet\npropagating a distance of order R from the Yukawa brane to probe supersymmetry\nbreaking. The physics of electroweak symmetry breaking is therefore closely\nrelated to this top propagation across the bulk, and is dominated by the mass\nscale 1/R, with exponential insensitivity to higher energy scales. The masses\nof the superpartners and the Kaluza-Klein resonances are also set by the mass\nscale 1/R, which is naturally larger than the W boson mass by a loop factor.\n  Explicit models are constructed which are highly constrained and predictive.\nThe finite radiative correction to the Higgs mass is computed, and the Higgs\nsector briefly explored.
