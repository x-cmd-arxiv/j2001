The\nX-ray emitting region is concentrated within the central $\\simeq 2$ pc of the\nlarger radio shell. The spectrum shows strong K$\\alpha$ lines from highly\nionized ions of S, Ar, Ca, and Fe.

The combination of the\nradio and X-ray morphologies classifies Sgr A East as a new metal-rich ``mixed\nmorphology'' (MM) SNR.
