The tidal field is further decomposed into a bulk velocity\nand a shear field. The method is applied here to the Mark III data within a\nsphere of radius 60 Mpc/h about the Local Group, and to the SFI data for\ncomparison.

In\nthis article, we show that if there is a sufficiently large cardinal above\nkappa, then no, it cannot. Conversely, if one weakens the requirement either by\ndemanding less indestructibility, such as requiring only indestructibility by\nstratified posets, or less level-by-level agreement, such as requiring it only\non measure one sets, then yes, it can.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Feb 2001 19:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The power spectra of such fractal\nspace-time fluctuations exhibit universal inverse power law form and signify\nlong-range correlations, identified as self-organized criticality . A cell\ndynamical system model developed by the author for turbulent fluid flows\nprovides a unique quantification for the observed power spectra in terms of the\nstatistical normal distribution, such that the variance represents the\nstatistical probability densities. Such a result that the additive amplitudes\nof eddies when squared, represent the statistical probabilities is an observed\nfeature of the subatomic dynamics of quantum systems such as an electron or\nphoton. Self-organized criticality is therefore a signature of quantum-like\nchaos in dynamical systems. The model concepts are applicable to all real\nworld(observed) and computed(mathematical model) dynamical systems.\n  Continuous periodogram analyses of the fractal fluctuations of Riemann zeta\nzero spacing intervals show that the power spectra follow the unique and\nuniversal inverse power law form of the statistical normal distribution. The\nRiemann zeta zeros therefore exhibit quantum-like chaos, the spacing intervals\nof the zeros representing the energy(variance) level spacings of quantum-like\nchaos inherent to dynamical systems in nature.
