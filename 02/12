The paper\naims in particular at the experimental validation of a new form of refined\nsimilarity recently proposed for the shear dominated range of turbulence, where\nthe classical Kolmogorov-Oboukhov inertial range theory is inappropriate. An\napproach inspired to the extended self-similarity allows for the extraction of\nthe different power laws for the longitudinal structure functions at several\nwall normal distances. A double scaling regime is found in the logarithmic\nregion, confirming previous experimental results. Approaching the wall, the\nscaling range corresponding to the classical cascade-dominated range tends to\ndisappear and, in the buffer layer, a single power law is found to describe the\navailable range of scales. The double scaling is shown to be associated with\ntwo different forms of refined similarity. The classical form holds below the\nshear scale L s . The other, originally introduced on the basis of DNS data for\na turbulent channel, is experimentally confirmed to set up above L s . Given\nthe experimental diffulties in the evaluation of the instantaneous dissipation\nrate, some care is devoted to check that its one-dimensional surrogate does not\nbias the results.
