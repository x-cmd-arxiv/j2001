One\nof the central questions is whether this new superconductor resembles a\nhigh-temperature-cuprate superconductor or a low-temperature metallic\nsuperconductor in terms of its current carrying characteristics in applied\nmagnetic fields. In spite of the very high transition temperatures of the\ncuprate superconductors, their performance in magnetic fields has several\ndrawbacks[2]. Their large anisotropy restricts high bulk current densities to\nmuch less than the full magnetic field-temperature (H-T) space over which\nsuperconductivity is found. Further, weak coupling across grain boundaries\nmakes transport current densities in untextured polycrystalline forms low and\nstrongly magnetic field sensitive[3,4]. These studies of MgB2 address both\nissues. In spite of the multi-phase, untextured, nano-scale sub-divided nature\nof our samples, supercurrents flow throughout without the strong sensitivity to\nweak magnetic fields characteristic of Josephson-coupled grains[3].\nMagnetization measurements over nearly all of the superconducting H-T plane\nshow good temperature scaling of the flux pinning force, suggestive of a\ncurrent density determined by flux pinning.

The\naveraging problem for scalar quantities is condensed into the problem of\nfinding an `effective equation of state' including kinematical as well as\ndynamical `backreaction' terms that measure the departure from a standard FLRW\ncosmology. Applications of the averaged models are outlined including\nradiation-dominated and scalar field cosmologies (inflationary and\ndilaton/string cosmologies). In particular, the averaged equations show that\nthe averaged scalar curvature must generically change in the course of\nstructure formation, that an averaged inhomogeneous radiation cosmos does not\nfollow the evolution of the standard homogeneous-isotropic model, and that an\naveraged inhomogeneous perfect fluid features kinematical `backreaction' terms\nthat, in some cases, act like a free scalar field source. The free scalar field\n(dilaton) itself, modelled by a `stiff' fluid, is singled out as a special\ninhomogeneous case where the averaged equations assume a simple form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2001 17:25:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2001 11:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Our first\ntheme is ilustrated by a quantum atomic black hole system, generalizing to\nfinite-temperature a model originally offered by Bekenstein. In this\nequilibrium atomic model, the black hole phase transition is realized as the\nabrupt excitation of a high energy state, suggesting analogies with the study\nof two-level atoms. Our second theme argues that the black hole system shares\nsimilarities with the defect-mediated Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in\ncondensed matter. These similarities suggest that the black hole phase\ntransition may be more fully understood by focusing upon the dynamics of black\nholes and white holes, the spacetime analogy of vortex and anti-vortex\ntopological defects. Finally we compare the black hole phase transition to\nanother transition driven by an exponentially increasing density of states, the\nHagedorn transition first found in hadron physics in the context of dual models\nor the old string theory. In modern string theory, the Hagedorn transition is\nlinked by the Maldacena conjecture to the Hawking-Page black hole phase\ntransition in Anti-deSitter space, as observed by Witten. Understanding the\ndynamics of the Hagedorn transition may thus yield insight into the dynamics of\nthe black hole phase transition. We argue that characteristics of the Hagedorn\ntransition are already contained within classical string systems where a\nnonperturbative and dynamical analysis is possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2001 21:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Hilbert's derivation used the variable r*\n=[C(0+)]^1/2. For Hilbert, however, C was unknown, and thus could not be used\nto determine r*(0). Instead he asserted, in effect, that r* = (x^2 + y^2 +\nz^2)^1/2, which places the point mass at r* = 0. Unfortunately, this differs\nfrom the value (a) obtained by substituting Schwarzschild's C into the\nexpression for r*(0), and since C(0+) is a scaler invariant, it follows that\nHilbert's assertion is invalid. Owing to this error, in each spatial section of\nHilbert's space-time, the boundary (r* = a) corresponding to r = 0 is no longer\na point, but a two-sphere.

There is probably no elementary condition on the f_i and their\nderivatives which determines whether the blowup of V along (f_0,...,f_m) is\nnonsingular. The result is that there indeed is such an elementary condition,\ninvolving the first and second derivatives of the $f_i,$ provided we admit\ncertain singular blowups, all of which can be resolved by an additional Nash\nblowup.\n  There is is a particular explicit sequence of ideals R=J_0, J_1, J_2,...\n\\subset R so that V_i=Bl_{J_i}V is the i'th Nash blowup of V, with J_i|J_{i+1}\nfor all i. Applying our earlier paper, V_i is nonsingular if and only if the\nideal class of J_{i+1} divides some power of the ideal class of J_i. The\npresent paper brings things down to earth considerably: such a divisibility of\nideal classes implies that for some N\\ge r+2\nJ_i^{N-r-2}J_{i+1}^{r+3}=J_i^NJ_{i+2}.\n  Yet note that this identity in turn implies J_{i+2} is a divisor of some\npower of J_{i+1}. Thus although $V_i$ may fail to be nonsingular, when the\nidentity holds the {\\it next} variety V_{i+1} must be nonsingular. Thus the\nNash question is equivalent to the assertion that the identity above holds for\nsome sufficiently large i and N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2001 12:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
