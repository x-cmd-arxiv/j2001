Starting from the\nbasic fluid-dynamical equations in three dimensions, I derive the fundamental\nset of one-dimensional equations that describe how the mass, angular momentum\nand eccentricity vector of a thin disc evolve as a result of internal stresses\nand external forcing. The analysis is asymptotically exact in the limit of a\nthin disc, and allows for slowly varying eccentricities of arbitrary magnitude.\nThe theory is worked out in detail for a Maxwellian viscoelastic model of the\nturbulent stress in an accretion disc. This generalizes the conventional alpha\nviscosity model to account for the non-zero relaxation time of the turbulence,\nand is physically motivated by a consideration of the nature of\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence. It is confirmed that circular discs are\ntypically viscously unstable to eccentric perturbations, as found by\nLyubarskij, Postnov & Prokhorov, if the conventional alpha viscosity model is\nadopted. However, the instability can usually be suppressed by introducing a\nsufficient relaxation time and/or bulk viscosity. It is then shown that an\ninitially uniformly eccentric disc does not retain its eccentricity as had been\nsuggested by previous analyses.

The RIMH models arise naturally within the\ncontext of SUSY SO(10) grand unified theories. In their original form, RIMH\nmodels suffer from two problems: 1.) obtaining the radiative breakdown of\nelectroweak symmetry, and 2.) generating the correct masses for third\ngeneration fermions. The first problem can be solved by the introduction of\nSO(10) D-term contributions to scalar masses. We show that correct fermion\nmasses can indeed be obtained, but at the cost of limiting the magnitude of the\nhierarchy that can be generated. We go on to compute predictions for the\nneutralino relic density as well as for the rate for the decay $b\\to s\\gamma$,\nand show that these yield significant constraints on model parameter space.

The mechanism is based on\nrecently conjectured QCD domain walls or similar CP violating domain walls with\nQCD scale structure. Such domain walls align the electric and magnetic dipole\nmoments of the nucleons shortly after the QCD phase transition, producing\nelectromagnetic fields correlated along the domain walls. Through the Kibble\nmechanism, the domain walls attain Hubble-scale correlations which they\ntransfer to the aligned electromagnetic fields. Due to the CP violation, the\nHubble-scale walls produce helical (non-zero Chern-Simons) magnetohydrodynamic\nturbulence which then undergoes an inverse cascade, allowing the correlation\nlengths to grow to 100 kpc today.
