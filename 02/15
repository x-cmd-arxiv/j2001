This paper expands on these original studies by\nconsidering the effect of planetary phase on the form of the resultant\nmicrolensing light curve. It is found that crescent-like sources can undergo\nsubstantially more magnification than a uniformly illuminated disk, the model\ntypically employed in studying such planets. In fact, such a circularly\nsymmetric model is found to suffer a minimal degree of magnification when\ncompared to the crescent models. The degree of magnification is also a strong\nfunction of the planet's orientation with respect to the microlensing caustic.\nThe form of the magnification variability is also strongly dependent on the\nplanetary phase and from which direction it is swept by the caustic, providing\nfurther clues to the geometry of the planetary system. As the amount of light\nreflected from a planet also depends on its phase, the detection of extreme\ncrescent-like planets requires the advent of 30-m class telescopes, while light\ncurves of planets at more moderate phases can be determined with today's 10-m\ntelescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2001 21:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

At\nsuperconductor surfaces, quasiparticles with energies inside the\nsuperconducting gap $\\Delta$ may be trapped in bound states in quantum wells,\nformed by total reflection against the vacuum and total Andreev reflection\nagainst the superconductor. Since an electron reflects as a hole and sends a\nCooper pair into the superconductor, the surface states give rise to resonant\ntransport of quasiparticle and Cooper pair currents, and may be observed in\ntunneling spectra. In superconducting junctions, these surface states may\nhybridize and form bound Andreev states, trapped between the superconducting\nelectrodes. In d-wave superconductors, the order parameter changes sign under\n$90^o$ rotation and, as a consequence, Andreev reflection may lead to the\nformation of zero energy quasiparticle bound states, midgap states (MGS).

However, in relativistic quantum\nfield theory (RQFT) its complete and exact solution is possible for a few\nsimple models only. Unitary transformations (UT's) considered in this survey do\nnot diagonalize H, but convert H into a form which enables us to find\napproximately some H eigenstates. During the last years there have appeared\nmany papers devoted to physical applications of such UT's. Our aim is to\npresent a systematic and self-sufficient exposition of the UT method. The two\ngeneral kinds of UT's are pointed out, distinct variations of each kind being\npossible. We consider in detail the problem of finding the simplest H\neigenstates for interacting mesons and nucleons using the so-called\n``clothing'' UT and Okubo's UT. These UT's allow us to suggest definite\napproaches to the problem of two-particle (deuteron-like) bound states in RQFT.\nThe approaches are shown to yield the same two-nucleon quasipotentials in the\nfirst nonvanishing approximation. We demonstrate how the particle mass\nrenormalization can be fulfilled in the framework of the ``clothing''\nprocedure. Besides the UT of the Hamiltonian we discuss the accompanying UT of\nthe Lorentz boost generators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2001 10:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

A misread codon will commonly code either for the\nsame amino acid or for a similar one in terms of its biochemical properties, so\nthe structure and function of the coded protein remain relatively unaltered.\nPrevious studies have attempted to address this question more quantitatively,\nnamely by statistically estimating the fraction of randomly generated codes\nthat do better than the genetic code regarding its overall robustness. In this\npaper, we extend these results by investigating the role of amino acid\nfrequencies in the optimality of the genetic code. When measuring the relative\nfitness of the natural code with respect to a random code, it is indeed natural\nto assume that a translation error affecting a frequent amino acid is less\nfavorable than that of a rare one, at equal mutation cost. We find that taking\nthe amino acid frequency into account accordingly decreases the fraction of\nrandom codes that beat the natural code, making the latter comparatively even\nmore robust. This effect is particularly pronounced when more refined measures\nof the amino acid substitution cost are used than hydrophobicity. To show this,\nwe devise a new cost function by evaluating with computer experiments the\nchange in folding free energy caused by all possible single-site mutations in a\nset of known protein structures. With this cost function, we estimate that of\nthe order of one random code out of 100 millions is more fit than the natural\ncode when taking amino acid frequencies into account. The genetic code seems\ntherefore structured so as to minimize the consequences of translation errors\non the 3D structure and stability of proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2001 16:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-03"}
