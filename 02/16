We detect a broad (100 km/s) and blueshifted (by 80\nkm/s) OVI absorption-line arising in the previously-known galactic outflow. The\nproperties of the OVI absorption are inconsistent with the standard superbubble\nmodel in which this gas arises in a conductive interface inside the outer\nshell.

As\nthe coronal gas cools radiatively, it can naturally produce the observed OVI\ncolumn density and outflow speed. The OVI data show that the cooling rate in\nthe coronal-phase gas is less than about 10% of the supernova heating rate.\nSince the X-ray luminosity from hotter gas is even smaller, we conclude that\nradiative losses are insignificant.

The surface brightness edge and the plateau can be modeled as a gas\ndensity discontinuity (jump) and a slope change (break). The temperature\nprofiles suggest that the jump and the break are the boundaries of a central,\ngroup-size (d=380h_50^{-1} kpc), dense, cold (T=4 keV) gas cloud, embedded in a\ndiffuse hot (T=10 keV) intracluster medium. The density jump and the\ntemperature change across the discontinuity are similar to the ``cold fronts''\ndiscovered by Chandra in A2142 and A3667, and suggest subsonic motion of this\ncentral gas cloud with respect to the cluster itself. The most natural\nexplanation is that we are observing a merger in the very last stage before the\ncluster becomes fully relaxed.

The conductance through such\ndots displays mesoscopic fluctuations as a function of gate voltage, magnetic\nfield, and shape deformation.

The cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation with a finite\nsquare well potential, which models a Bose-Einstein condensate in a\nquasi-one-dimensional trap of finite depth, is solved for the complete set of\nlocalized and partially localized stationary states, which the former evolve\ninto when the nonlinearity is increased. An immediate application of these\ndifferent solution types is tunable tunneling. Magnetically tunable Feshbach\nresonances can change the scattering length of certain Bose-condensed atoms,\nsuch as $^{85}$Rb, by several orders of magnitude, including the sign, and\nthereby also change the mean field nonlinearity term of the equation and the\ntunneling of the wavefunction. We find both linear-type localized solutions and\nuniquely nonlinear partially localized solutions where the tails of the\nwavefunction become nonzero at infinity when the nonlinearity increases. The\ntunneling of the wavefunction into the non-classical regime and thus its\nlocalization therefore becomes an external experimentally controllable\nparameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2001 00:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We describe as an example a scheme to\nprepare arbitrary entangled states of N two-level atoms using a leaky optical\ncavity and a scheme to entangle atoms inside a photonic crystal. During the\nstate preparation no photons are emitted and observing a violation of Bell's\ninequality is the only way to test whether a scheme works with a high precision\nor not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2001 08:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

We have examined two versions of\nthe concept of ``possessed values'': one identical with the observed values and\nthe other non-identical. Assuming the existence of such ``physical quantities\npossessed by the system'' and subjecting it to the framework of Bell theorem\nunder very generous condition allowing even certain form of ``nonlocality'',\none can still arrive at the proper Bell's inequality. With the experimental\nfalsification of Bell's inequality, we conclude that the concept of ``possessed\nvalues'' finds no place in proper physical reasoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2001 13:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
