All significant instrumental effects are taken\ninto account, and two kinds of sources are considered -- unresolved sources\nrepresented by the telescope PSF and extended ones represented by a b-profile\nmodel. Different sets of test cases with controlled and realistic input\nconfigurations are constructed in order to analyze the influence of confusion\non the source analysis and also to choose the best methods and strategies to\nresolve the difficulties.\n  In the general case of point-like and extended objects the mixed approach of\nmultiresolution (wavelet) filtering and subsequent detection by SExtractor\ngives the best results. In ideal cases of isolated sources, flux errors are\nwithin 15-20%. The maximum likelihood technique outperforms the others for\npoint-like sources when the PSF model used in the fit is the same as in the\nimages. However, the number of spurious detections is quite large.\n  The classification using the half-light radius and SExtractor stellarity\nindex is succesful in more than 98% of the cases. This suggests that average\nluminosity clusters of galaxies (L_[2-10] ~ 3x10^{44} erg/s) can be detected at\nredshifts greater than 1.5 for moderate exposure times in the energy band below\n5 keV, provided that there is no confusion or blending by nearby sources.\n  We find also that with the best current available packages, confusion and\ncompleteness problems start to appear at fluxes around 6x10^{-16} erg/s/cm^2 in\n[0.5-2] keV band for XMM deep surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2001 17:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We vary the compaction of the star $M/R$\n(where $M$ is the gravitational mass and $R$ the equatorial circumferential\nradius) between 0.01 and 0.05 to isolate the influence of relativistic\ngravitation on the instability. For compactions in this moderate range, the\ncritical value of $\\beta = T/W$ for the onset of the dynamical instability\n(where $T$ is the rotational kinetic energy and W the gravitational binding\nenergy) slightly decreases from $\\sim$ 0.26 to $\\sim$ 0.25 with increasing\ncompaction for our choice of the differential rotational law. Combined with our\nearlier findings based on simulations in full general relativity for stars with\nhigher compaction, we conclude that relativistic gravitation enhances the\ndynamical bar-mode instability, i.e. the onset of instability sets in for\nsmaller values of $\\beta$ in relativistic gravity than in Newtonian gravity. We\nalso find that once a triaxial structure forms after the bar-mode perturbation\nsaturates in dynamically unstable stars, the triaxial shape is maintained, at\nleast for several rotational periods. To check the reliability of our numerical\nintegrations, we verify that the general relativistic Kelvin-Helmholtz\ncirculation is well-conserved, in addition to rest-mass and total mass-energy,\nlinear and angular momentum. Conservation of circulation indicates that our\ncode is not seriously affected by numerical viscosity. We determine the\namplitude and frequency of the quasi-periodic gravitational waves emitted\nduring the bar formation process using the quadrupole formula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2001 23:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Moreover spins for particles are naturally generated,\nincluding an approximation of their interaction with magnetic fields.
