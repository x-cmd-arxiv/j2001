We\nmodify the extended Press-Schechter formalism to derive the halo mass function\nin WDM models. We show that our predictions agree with recent numerical\nsimulations at low redshift over the halo masses of interest. Applying our\nmodel to galaxy formation at high redshift, we find that the loss of power on\nsmall scales, together with the delayed collapse of low-mass objects, results\nin strong limits on the root-mean-square velocity dispersion v_rms of the WDM\nparticles at z=0. For fermions decoupling while relativistic, these limits are\nequivalent to constraints on the mass m_X of the particles. The presence of a 4\nbillion solar mass black hole at z=5.8, believed to power the quasar SDSS\n1044-1215, implies m_X > 0.5 keV (or v_rms < 0.10 km/s), assuming that the\nquasar is unlensed and radiating at or below the Eddington limit. Reionization\nby z=5.8 also implies a limit on m_X. If high-redshift galaxies produce\nionizing photons with an efficiency similar to their z=3 counterparts, we find\nm_X > 1.2 keV (or v_rms < 0.03 km/s). However, given the uncertainties in\ncurrent measurements from the proximity effect of the ionizing background at\nredshift 3, values of m_X as low as 0.75 keV (v_rms = 0.06 km/s) are not ruled\nout. The limit weakens further if, instead, the ionizing-photon production\nefficiency is greater at high z, but this limit will tighten considerably if\nreionization is shown in the future to have occurred at higher redshifts. WDM\nmodels with m_X < 1 keV (v_rms > 0.04 km/s) produce a low-luminosity cutoff in\nthe high-redshift galaxy luminosity function which is directly detectable with\nthe Next Generation Space Telescope (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Feb 2001 03:01:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 May 2001 14:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We find that (1) the source is not intrinsically X-ray weak, (2)\nthe line of sight absorption is very strong with N_H=5 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, (3)\nthe absorber does not cover the source completely; the covering fraction is\nabout 90%. This is consistent with the large optical polarization observed in\nthis source, implying multiple lines of sight. The most surprising result of\nthis observation is that (4) the spectrum of this BALQSO is not exactly similar\nto other radio-quiet quasars. The hard X-ray spectrum of PHL 5200 is steep with\nthe power-law spectral index alpha ~1.5. This is similar to the steepest hard\nX-ray slopes observed so far. At low redshifts, such steep slopes are observed\nin narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies, believed to be accreting at a high Eddington\nrate.
