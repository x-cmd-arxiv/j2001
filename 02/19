We link the\ndifferentiability of Mather's beta-function with the topological complexity of\nthe complement of the Aubry set. As a consequence, when the dimension of the\nmanifold is less than or equal to two, the differentiability of the\nbeta-function at a given homology class is forced by the irrationality of the\nhomology class. As an application we prove the two-dimensional case of a\nconjecture by Ricardo Mane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2001 14:50:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 May 2001 11:48:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2006 17:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
