The datasets are PSCz, ORS, Mark III and SFI. The\nLAP method is applied on the surveys simultaneously, resulting in an\noverconstrained dynamical system that describes the cosmic overdensities and\nvelocity flows. The system is solved by relaxing the constraint that each\nsurvey imposes upon the cosmic fields. A least-squares optimization of the\nerrors that arise in the process yields the cosmic fields and the value of\nOmega_m that is the best fit to the ensemble of datasets. The analysis has been\ncarried out with a high-resolution Gaussian smoothing of 500 km/s and over a\nspherical selected volume of radius 9,000 km/s. We have assigned a weight to\neach survey, depending on their density of sampling, and this parameter\ndetermines their relative influence in limiting the domain of the overall\nsolution. The influence of each survey on the final value of Omega_m, the\ncosmographical features of the cosmic fields and the power spectra largely\ndepends on the distribution function of the errors in the relaxation of the\nconstraints. We find that PSCz and Mark III are closer to the final solution\nthan ORS and SFI. The likelihood analysis yields Omega_m= 0.37\\pm 0.01 to\n1sigma level. PSCz and SFI are the closest to this value, whereas ORS and Mark\nIII predict a somewhat lower Omega_m. The model of bias employed is a\nscale-dependent one, and we retain up to 42 bias coefficients b_{rl} in the\nspherical harmonics formalism. The predicted power spectra are estimated in the\nrange of wavenumbers 0.02-0.49h Mpc^{-1}, and we compare these results with\nmeasurements recently reported in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2001 16:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

In this picture,\nthe viscosity is produced by MHD turbulence due to the magneto-rotational\ninstability ('Balbus-Hawley instability') and dies down exponentially with time\nwhen the disk becomes cold because the magnetic fields decay due to finite\nconductivity in the cold disk (Gammie & Menou 1998). But the viscosity is\nrefreshed to a high value every time when a mini-outburst occurs (i.e., the\ndisk becomes hot again).

There exist unique random variables, whose standard deviation\nbecomes asymptotically invariant of physical conditions. Representing all\ninformation by means of such random variables gives the quantum mechanical\nprobability amplitude and a real alternative. For predictions, the linear\nevolution law (Schrodinger or Dirac equation) turns out to be the only way to\nextend the invariance property of the standard deviation to the predicted\nquantities. This indicates that quantum theory originates in the structure of\ngaining pure, probabilistic information, without any mechanical underpinning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2001 10:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}
