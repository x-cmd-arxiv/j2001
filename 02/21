It is not yet known whether such\nlayers can exist in a very low viscosity fluid: this work undertakes to address\nthat question. Layering is simulated numerically both at high Prandtl number\n(relevant to the laboratory) in order to describe the onset of layering\nintability, and the astrophysically important case of low Prandtl number. It is\nargued that the critical stability parameter for interfaces between layers, the\nRichardson number, increases with decreasing Prandtl number. Throughout the\nsimulations the fluid has a tendency to form large scale flows in the first\nconvecting layer, but only at low Prandtl number do such structures have\ndramatic consequences for layering. These flows are shown to drive large\ninterfacial waves whose breaking contributes to significant mixing across the\ninterface. An effective diffusion coefficient is determined from the simulation\nand is shown to be much greater than the predictions of both an enhanced\ndiffusion model and one which specifically incorporates wave breaking. The\nresults further suggest that molecular weight gradient interfaces are\nineffective barriers to mixing even when specified as initial conditions, such\nas would arise when a compositional gradient is redistributed by another\nmechanism than buoyancy, such as rotation or internal waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2001 16:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This interaction becomes strongly singular in the deep\ninfrared domain leading thus to the enhancement of zero momentum modes in the\nnonperturbative QCD vacuum. Using theory of distributions, complemented by the\ndimensional regularization method, we have explicitly shown that strong\ninfrared singularities can be put under control. In this way a new phase in\nQCD, intrinsically nonperturbative QCD which is manifestly gauge invariant, was\ndiscovered. As a result, a highly nontrivial dynamical and topological\nstructure of the QCD vacuum has emerged within our approach.

As the analysis of the\nBianchi identities reveals, a new vector superfield is encountered besides the\nwell-known scalar one. The constraints are solved both with superfields using a\nspecial decomposition of the supervielbein, and explicitly in terms of\ncomponent fields in a Wess-Zumino gauge. The graded Poisson Sigma Model (gPSM)\nis the alternative method used to construct supersymmetric gravity theories. In\nthis context the graded Jacobi identity is solved algebraically for general\ncases. Some of the Poisson algebras obtained are singular, or several\npotentials contained in them are restricted. This is discussed for a selection\nof representative algebras. It is found, that the gPSM is far more flexible and\nit shows the inherent ambiguity of the supersymmetric extension more clearly\nthan the superfield method. Among the various models spherically reduced\nEinstein gravity and gravity with torsion are treated. Also the Legendre\ntransformation to eliminate auxiliary fields, superdilaton theories and the\nexplicit solution of the gPSM equations of motion for a typical model are\npresented. Furthermore, the PSM field equations are analyzed in detail, leading\nto the so called \"symplectic extension\". Thereby, the Poisson tensor is\nextended to become regular by adding new coordinates to the target space. For\ngravity models this is achieved with one additional coordinate. Finally, the\nrelation of the gPSM to the superfield method is established by extending the\nbase manifold to become a supermanifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2001 15:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
