The sheer number of inferred SXTs\nrequires that many, if not most, stars of ZAMS masses $20-35\\msun$ end up as\nblack holes (Portegies Zwart et al. 1997; Ergma & van den Heuvel 1998). In this\npaper we show that this can be understood by challenging the accepted wisdom\nthat the result of helium core burning in a massive star is independent of\nwhether the core is covered by a hydrogen envelope, or \"naked\" while it burns.\nThe latter case occurs in binaries when the envelope of the more massive star\nis transferred to the companion by Roche Lobe overflow while in either main\nsequence or red giant stage. For solar metallicity, whereas the helium cores\nwhich burn while naked essentially never go into high-mass black holes, those\nthat burn while clothed do so, beginning at ZAMS mass $\\sim 20\\msun$, the\nprecise mass depending on the $^{12}C(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{16}$O rate as we outline.\nIn this way the SXTs can be evolved, provided that the H envelope of the\nmassive star is removed only following the He core burning. We also show that\nin order to evolve a black hole of mass $\\gsim 10\\msun$ such as observed in Cyg\nX-1, even employing extremely massive progenitors of ZAMS mass $\\gsim 60\\msun$\nfor the black hole, the core must be covered by hydrogen during a substantial\nfraction of the core burning. In other words, the progenitor must be a WNL\nstar.

In order to avoid the forward escape\ncorresponding to the attribution of a substructure to quarks and to stand away\nfrom the conceptual strangling to which the Standard model has led, we have\ninstead opted for different fundamentals. These, in contrast to those of the\nStandard Model, are extremely simple and based on the assumption of a single\nfundamental corpuscle, of dual manifestation as corpuscle and anticorpuscle, to\nwhich is always associated an orbital that determines the structure of\nparticles.
