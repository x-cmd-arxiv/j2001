The first issue deals with the trend between the half-light radius\nand the structural parameter n. We show that the correlation between these two\nparameters is not only real, but is a natural consequence from the previous\nrelations found to exist between the model-independent parameters: total\nluminosity, effective radius and effective surface brightness. We also define a\nnew galaxy concentration index which is largely independent of the image\nexposure depth, and monotonically related with n. The second question concerns\nthe curious coincidence between the form of the Fundamental Plane and the\ncoupling between <I>_e and r_e when modelling a light profile. We explain,\nthrough a mathematical analysis of the S\\'ersic law, why the quantity\nr_e<I>_e^{0.7} appears almost constant for an individual galaxy, regardless of\nthe value of n (over a large range) adopted in the fit to the light profile.\nConsequently, Fundamental Planes of the form r_e<I>_e^{0.7} propto sigma_0^x\n(for any x, and where sigma_0 is the central galaxy velocity dispersion) are\ninsensitive to galaxy structure. Finally, we address the problematic issue of\nthe use of model-dependent galaxy light profile parameters versus\nmodel-independent quantities for the half-light radii, mean surface brightness\nand total galaxy magnitude. The former implicitly assume that the light profile\nmodel can be extrapolated to infinity, while the latter quantities, in general,\nare derived from a signal-to-noise truncated profile.

We show that the SK detector response to\nB neutrinos in each bin of the electron energy spectrum (above 8 MeV) can be\napproximated, with good accuracy, by the SNO detector response in an\nappropriate electron energy range (above 5.1 MeV). For instance, the SK\nresponse in the bin [10,10.5] MeV is reproduced (``equalized'') within 2\npercent by the SNO response in the range [7.1,11.75] MeV.

Such equalization is not spoiled by the\npossible contribution of hep neutrinos (within current phenomenological\nlimits).

The statistical\nstructure of signal usage is predicted to be of a generalised Boltzmann form\nthat penalises signals that are costly and sensitive to errors.
