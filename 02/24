Of\nthe three, MF83 was considered the most likely candidate for such an object due\nto its size, nature, and close positional coincidence. However, we find that\nMF83 is clearly ruled out as a hypernova remnant by both its temporal\nvariability and spectrum. The bright X-ray sources previously associated with\nMF54 and MF57 are seen by Chandra to be clearly offset from the optical\npositions of the supernova remnants by several arc seconds, confirming a result\nsuggested by the previous work.

As an application of\nour framework, we also present a formal investigation of the relations between\nLO and Disjunctive Logic Programming.

The two technical pillars of the project were the\ndevelopment of axiomatic systems for ever stronger and more comprehensive areas\nof mathematics and finitistic proofs of consistency of these systems. Early\nadvances in these areas were made by Hilbert (and Bernays) in a series of\nlecture courses at the University of Goettingen between 1917 and 1923, and\nnotably in Ackermann's dissertation of 1924. The main innovation was the\ninvention of the epsilon-calculus, on which Hilbert's axiom systems were based,\nand the development of the epsilon-substitution method as a basis for\nconsistency proofs. The paper traces the development of the \"simultaneous\ndevelopment of logic and mathematics\" through the epsilon-notation and provides\nan analysis of Ackermann's consistency proofs for primitive recursive\narithmetic and for the first comprehensive mathematical system, the latter\nusing the substitution method. It is striking that these proofs use transfinite\ninduction not dissimilar to that used in Gentzen's later consistency proof as\nwell as non-primitive recursive definitions, and that these methods were\naccepted as finitistic at the time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 2001 02:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A weakly conducting,\nsubmicron thick smectic liquid crystal film was supported by concentric\ncircular electrodes. It electroconvected when a sufficiently large voltage $V$\nwas applied between its inner and outer edges. The film could sustain rapid\nflows and yet remain strictly two-dimensional. By rotation of the inner\nelectrode, a circular Couette shear could be independently imposed. The control\nparameters were a dimensionless number ${\\cal R}$, analogous to the Rayleigh\nnumber, which is $\\propto V^2$ and the Reynolds number ${\\cal R}e$ of the\nazimuthal shear flow. The geometrical and material properties of the film were\ncharacterized by the radius ratio $\\alpha$, and a Prandtl-like number ${\\cal\nP}$. Using measurements of current-voltage characteristics of a large number of\nfilms, we examined the onset of electroconvection over a broad range of\n$\\alpha$, ${\\cal P}$ and ${\\cal R}e$. We compared this data quantitatively to\nthe results of linear stability theory. This could be done with essentially no\nadjustable parameters.

Stasiak and colleagues devised\na constructive method for a knot \"energy\" using a Metropolis Monte Carlo\nalgorithm to minimize the length of rope needed to realize a given knot for a\nrope of a fixed diameter. They called the resulting rendering of the knot the\n\"ideal\" configuration. They have found (i) that the 3-dimensional (3D) writhe\nof the ideal configuration of a knot appeared, empirically, to be quantized;\n(ii) empirically, the 3D writhe of the ideal configuration was additive over\ncomposition of knots; and (iii) the 3D writhe of ideal configuration of\nalternating knots (which have a projection in which crossings alternate between\nover and under as one transverses the knot in a fixed direction) seems to be\nequal, to 1*T + 3/7*(W-B), where T is the \"Tait number,\" and W and B are the\nnumber of the white and black regions in the checkerboard coloring of the knot.\nIt is still not clear why properties i-iii might be true. Here I show that all\nthese empirical findings can be related to the fact that T and W-B can be\nproven to be additive over composition of alternating knots. In particular, (1)\nthe 3D writhe of ideal configurations is likely only to be additive for\ncomposition of alternating knots, and (2) remarkably, the geometrical structure\nof all alternating (even prime) knots is determined by the three smallest\nknots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 2001 00:24:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
