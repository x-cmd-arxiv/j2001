The author produced a paper in 1998 outlining\na possible method of attack on the problem based on shift equivalence\nprinciples (\"Doppler mass shift\"). Some problems with this paper have since\ncome to light. We list some further developments, some papers not cited in\ngr-qc/9807084, some experimental results missed by the author, and identify a\nproblem with the paper's approach to aberration effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Feb 2001 22:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Computer program, based on new theory, was used for\nsimulations of big number of physical properties of water and ice. Condensed\nmatter is considered as a superposition of 3D standing waves (collective\nexcitations) of different nature: thermal de Broglie waves, IR photons and\nthermal phonons. New theories of total internal energy, heat capacity, surface\ntension, vapor pressure, thermal conductivity, viscosity and self-diffusion are\ndescribed. Hierarchic theory of osmotic pressure, based on new state equation,\nnew theories of light refraction, Brillouin light scattering and Mossbauer\neffect are presented also and compared with available experimental data for\nwater and ice. The agreement between theoretical and available experimental\nresults for water and ice is very good. New approach to the turbulence,\nsuperfluidity and superconductivity is developed. A lot of applications of new\ntheory to biophysics, including model of Quantum of Mind are described.
