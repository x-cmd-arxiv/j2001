After scaling\nfor this effect, the three softest bands (0.1-1.7 keV) showed strong\ncorrelation with no measurable lag to reliable limits of $\\tau \\ls 0.3$ hr.\nHowever, the hardest band (~3 keV) was less well-correlated with the other\nthree, especially on short time scales, showing deviations of ~10-20% in ~1 hr\nalthough, again, no significant interband lag was detected. This result and\nexamination of previous ASCA and BeppoSAX cross-correlation functions suggest\nthat previous claims of soft lags on time scales of 0.3-4 hr could well be an\nartifact of periodic interruptions due to Earth-occultation every 1.6 hr.\nPrevious determinations of the magnetic field/bulk Lorentz factor were\ntherefore premature, as these data provide only a lower limit of $B\n\\gamma^{1/3} \\gs 2.5$ G. The hardest band encompasses the spectral region above\nthe high-energy break; its enhanced variability could be indicating that the\nbreak energy of the synchrotron spectrum, and therefore of the underlying\nelectron energy distribution, changes independently of the lower energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2001 04:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

However, more and more observations on relativistic jets in\nradio galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and \"microquasars\" in the Galaxy have\nshown that many of these outflows are not conical, but cylindrical, i.e., they\nmaintain constant cross sections at large scales. Thus it is necessary to\ndiscuss the possibility that GRBs may be due to highly collimated cylindrical\njets, not conical ones. Here we study the dynamical evolution of cylindrical\njets and discuss their afterglows. Both analytical and numerical results are\npresented. It is shown that when the lateral expansion is not taken into\naccount, a cylindrical jet typically remains to be highly relativistic for \\sim\n10^8 - 10^9 s. During this relativistic phase, the optical afterglow decays as\n\\propto t^{-p/2} at first, where p is the index characterizing the power-law\nenergy distribution of electrons. Then the light curve steepens to be \\propto\nt^{-(p+1)/2} due to cooling of electrons. After entering the non-relativistic\nphase (i.e., t > 10^{11} s), the afterglow is \\propto t^{-(5p-4)/6}. But if the\ncylindrical jet expands laterally at co-moving sound speed, then the decay\nbecomes \\propto t^{-p} and \\propto t^{-(15p-21)/10} - t^{-(15p-20)/10} in the\nultra-relativistic and non-relativistic phase respectively. Note that in both\ncases, the light curve turns flatter after the relativistic-Newtonian\ntransition point, which differs markedly from the behaviour of a conical jet.\nIt is suggested that some GRBs with afterglows decaying as t^{-1.1} - t^{-1.3}\nmay be due to cylindrical jets, not necessarily isotropic fireballs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2001 10:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
