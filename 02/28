If instead these values are significantly\nlower (for example, similar to the 1-sigma limits), then the typical cloud is\ngenerally magnetically supercritical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2001 16:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Rather,\nthey are elongated, perhaps in the direction of their internal magnetic field.\nWe are thus motivated to consider the structure and evolution of axisymmetric,\nmagnetized clouds that start from a variety of initial states, both flattened\n(oblate) and elongated (prolate). We devise a new technique, dubbed the\n$q$-method, that allows us to construct magnetostatic equilibria of any\nspecified shape. We find, in agreement with previous authors, that the field\nlines in oblate clouds bend inward. However, those in prolate clouds bow\noutward, confining the structures through magnetic tension.\n  We next follow the quasi-static evolution of these clouds via ambipolar\ndiffusion, under the assumption of constant core mass. An oblate cloud either\nrelaxes to a magnetically force-free sphere or, if sufficiently massive,\nflattens along its polar axis as its central density runs away. A prolate cloud\nalways relaxes to a sphere of modest central density. We finally consider the\nevolution of an initially spherical cloud subject to the tidal gravity of\nneighboring bodies. Although the structure constricts equatorially, it also\nshortens along the pole, so that it ultimately flattens on the way to collapse.\nIn summary, none of our initial states can evolve to the point of collapse\nwhile maintaining an elongated shape.

We construct simple\nanalytical models for the viscous evolution of fallback disks to show that it\nis possible for these disks to become neutral when they are still young (ages\nof a few 10^3 to 10^4 years), compact in size (a few 10^9 cm to 10^11 cm) and\ngenerally accreting at sub-Eddington rates (Mdot ~ a few 10^14 - 10^18 g/s).\nBased on recent results on the nature of viscosity in the disks of close\nbinaries, we argue that this time may also correspond to the end of the disk\nactivity period.

SNe IIn are distinguished\nby relatively narrow emission lines with little or no P-Cygni absorption\ncomponent and (quite often) slowly declining light curves; they probably have\nunusually dense circumstellar gas with which the ejecta interact. Some SNe IIn,\nhowever, might not be genuine SNe, but rather are ``impostors'' ---\nspecifically, super-outbursts of luminous blue variables. SNe Ib do not exhibit\nthe deep 6150 Angstrom absorption characteristic of ``classical'' SNe Ia;\ninstead, their early-time spectra have He I absorption lines. SNe Ic appear\nsimilar to SNe Ib, but lack the helium lines as well. Spectra of SNe IIb\ninitially exhibit hydrogen, yet gradually evolve to resemble those of SNe Ib;\ntheir progenitors seem to contain only a low-mass skin of hydrogen.\nSpectropolarimetry thus far indicates large asymmetries in the ejecta of SNe\nIIn, but much smaller ones in SNe II-P. As one peers deeper into the ejecta of\ncore-collapse SNe, the asymmetry (indicated by the amount of polarization)\nseems to increase. There is intriguing, but inconclusive, evidence that some\npeculiar SNe IIn might be associated with gamma-ray bursts.
