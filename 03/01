Two most intriguing properties of\nSakurai's objects have so far not been understood theoretically: the peculiar\nchemical appearance, in particular the high lithium abundance and the short\ntime scale of only a few years on which the transition from the dwarf\nconfiguration into the born again giant appearance has occurred. A new\nnucleosynthesis mode of hot hydrogen-deficient He3 burning can explain the\nextraordinary lithium abundance. During the thermal pulse He3 is ingested from\nthe envelope together with the protons into the hot He-flash convection zone.\nThe first network calculations show that due to the large C12 abundance protons\nare rather captured by carbon than destroy newly formed Be7 and ultimately Li7.\nMoreover, the short evolution time scale has been reproduced by making the\nassumption that the convective efficiency for element mixing is smaller by two\nto three orders of magnitude than predicted by the mixing-length theory. As a\nresult the main energy generation from fast convective proton capture will\noccur at a larger mass coordinate, closer to the surface and the expansion to\nthe giant state is accelerated to a few years in agreement with Sakurai's\nbehavior.

Bringing a field theory point of view to\nfracture illuminates things in what I hope will be an entertaining way.\n  Formally, what is the crack nucleation rate? Fracture is an instability of\nelastic theory under tension. For thermally nucleated cracks, there is an\nanalogy with supercooled liquids. Here the crack nucleation rate can be thought\nof as an imaginary part of the free energy - giving the decay rate of the\nmetastable, stretched material. As an amusing consequence, we can formally\ncalculate the asymptotic form for the high-order nonlinear elastic\ncoefficients, and explicitly show that elastic theory has zero radius of\nconvergence.\n  Formally, can we derive the the crack growth laws from symmetry? We can\ndescribe mixed-mode three-dimensional fracture as a moving curve in space,\ndecorated with a description of the local crack plane, and driven by the stress\nintensity factors along the crack. Imposing the symmetries gives us the form of\nthe crack growth laws in two dimensions, explaining the (well-known) fact that\ncracks under shear (mode II) abruptly turn until the stress becomes purely\nextensional (mode I). The form of the crack growth law in three dimensions will\nbe derived, and linear stability analysis for mixed-mode fracture will be\nbriefly summarized, with connection to factory-roof morphologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2001 18:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nfirst transition is into a glassy phase, topologically disordered at the\nlargest length scales; current evidence suggests that it lacks the long-ranged\nphase correlations expected of a ``vortex glass''. This phase has a significant\ndegree of short-ranged translational order, unlike the disordered liquid, but\nno quasi-long range order, in contrast to the Bragg glass. This glassy phase,\nwhich we call a ``multi-domain glass'', is confined to a narrow sliver at\nintermediate fields, but broadens out both for much larger and much smaller\nfield values.

Universal soft breaking (mSUGRA) models, and models\nwith non-universal Higgs and third generation squark/slepton masses at M_G are\nconsidered. All relic density constraints from stau-neutralino co-annihilation\nand large \\tan\\beta NLO corrections for b \\to s\\gamma decay are included, and\nwe consider two possibilities for the light Higgs: m_h > 114 GeV and m_h > 120\nGeV. The combined m_h, b \\to s\\gamma and a_{\\mu} bounds give rise to lower\nbounds on \\tan\\beta and m_{1/2}, while the lower bound on a_{\\mu} gives rise to\nan upper bounds on m_{1/2}. These bounds are sensitive to A_0, e.g. for m_h >\n114 GeV, the 95% C.L. is \\tan\\beta > 7(5) for A_0 = 0(-4m_{1/2}), and for m_h >\n120 GeV, \\tan\\beta > 15(10). The positive sign of the a_{\\mu} deviation implies\n\\mu > 0, eliminating the extreme cancellations in the dark matter\nneutralino-proton detection cross section so that almost all the SUSY parameter\nspace should be accessible to future planned detectors. Most of the allowed\nparts of parameter space occur in the co-annihilation region where m_0 is\nstrongly correlated with m_{1/2}. The lower bound on a_{\\mu} then greatly\nreduces the allowed parameter space. Thus using 90% C. L. bounds on a_{\\mu} we\nfind for A_0 = 0 that \\tan\\beta \\geq 10 and for \\tan\\beta \\leq 40 that m_{1/2}\n= (290 - 550) GeV and m_0 = (70 - 300) GeV. Then the tri-lepton signal and\nother SUSY signals would be beyond the Tevatron Run II (except for the light\nHiggs), only the \\tilde{\\tau}_1 and h and (and for part of the parameter space)\nthe \\tilde{e}_1 will be accessible to a 500 GeV NLC, while the LHC would be\nable to see the full SUSY mass spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2001 17:22:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The studies are implemented in\niodine vapor, with its thermally occupied statistical ro-vibrational density\nserving as initial state. The evolution of the massive ro-vibronic\nsuperpositions, consisting of 1000 eigenstates, is followed through\ntwo-dimensional images. The first- and second-order coherences are captured\nusing time-integrated frequency-resolved CARS, while the third-order coherence\nis captured using time-gated frequency-resolved CARS. The Fourier filtering\nprovided by time integrated detection projects out single ro-vibronic\ntransitions, while time-gated detection allows the projection of arbitrary\nro-vibronic superpositions from the coherent third-order polarization. Beside\nthe control and imaging of chemistry, the controlled manipulation of massive\nquantum coherences suggests the possibility of quantum computing. We argue that\nthe universal logic gates necessary for arbitrary quantum computing - all\nsingle qubit operations and the two-qubit controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate - are\navailable in time resolved four-wave mixing in a molecule. The molecular\nrotational manifold is naturally \"wired\" for carrying out all single qubit\noperations efficiently, and in parallel. We identify vibronic coherences as one\nexample of a naturally available two-qubit CNOT gate, wherein the vibrational\nqubit controls the switching of the targeted electronic qubit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2001 18:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
