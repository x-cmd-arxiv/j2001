The disintegration of a small\nmultiple system is a stochastic process, which can be described only in terms\nof the half-life of the decay. A stellar embryo competes with its siblings in\norder to accrete infalling matter, and the one that grows slowest is most\nlikely to be ejected.

Possible observational tests of this\nscenario include statistics of brown dwarfs near Class 0 sources, and the\nkinematics of brown dwarfs in star forming regions while they still retain a\nkinematic signature of their expulsion.

The variation of the mass outflow from the binary system with\nthe orbital phase leads to a large-scale departure from axisymmetry along the\nequatorial plane, as is observed in Eta Car. I further speculated that such a\ncompanion may have accreted a large fraction of the mass that was expelled in\nthe Great Eruption of 1850 and the Lesser Eruption of 1890.

The ground state corresponds to\ntwo correlated condensates: that of the bosons and that of the phonons. Two\ncompeting effects determine the common collective soundwave-like mode with\nsound velocity $v$, arising from gauge symmetry breaking: i) The sound velocity\n$v_0$ (corresponding to a weakly interacting Bose system on a rigid lattice) in\nthe lowest order approximation is reduced due to reduction of the repulsive\nboson-boson interaction, arising from the attractive part of phonon mediated\ninteraction in the static limit. ii) the second order correction to the sound\nvelocity is enhanced as compared to the one of bosons on a rigid lattice when\nthe the boson-phonon interaction is switched on due to the retarded nature of\nphonon mediated interaction. The overall effect is that the sound velocity is\npractically unaffected by the coupling with phonons, indicating the robustness\nof the superfluid state. The induction of a coherent state in the phonon\nsystem, driven by the condensation of the bosons could be of experimental\nsignificance, permitting spectroscopic detections of superfluid properties of\nthe bosons. Our results are based on an extension of the Beliaev - Popov\nformalism for a weakly interacting Bose gas on a rigid lattice to that on a\ndeformable lattice with which it interacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2001 13:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The model is characterized by the Cu-O site energy splitting, the\nCu-O first neighbor hopping and the O-O second neighbor hopping. For the\nsufficiently large O-O hoppings, two bands can come together at one point on\nthe diagonal of the square Brillouin zone, but they cannot cross. The range of\nthe parameters for which the band touching occurs is determined. The model\nrelates the band touching at the bottom of the two bands to the appearance of\nthe extended, one-dimensional-like van Hove singularity at the lower edge of\nthe density of states. With 1+\\delta holes (\\delta small) the extended van Hove\nsingularity can thus occur close to the Fermi level only if the latter cuts two\nbands.The topology of the Fermi surfaces observed by ARPES in the high-Tc\nsuperconductors elliminates such possibility. The Fermi surfaces in LSCO,\nBi1221 and Y123 are than fitted with the one of the three bands at the Fermi\nlevel. The agreement is excellent considering in particular the fact that the\nfits use only two parameters. The departure of the measured band structure from\nthe three band prediction, found on the small energy scales away from the Fermi\nlevel, is attributed to the effects of the fluctuations not included into the\nenergy scales which define the three band structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2001 14:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2001 08:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

WTPF's are bare propagators,\none-loop self-energies, retarded and advanced components of the resummed\npropagator. Among WTPF's convolution product is very simple, one does not need\ngradient expansion. However, WTPF's are completely determined by their infinite\ntime limit and, thus, cannot be the carriers of relaxation phenomena.\nFurthermore, we observe that the functions capable of carrying relaxation\nphenomena (non-WTPF) emerge in the mixed (\"ill-defined\") products of retarded\nand advanced propagators and self-energies. In particular, only non-WTPF's\ncontribute to time variation of equal-time Green functions (particle number,\netc.); contributions from WTPF will be constant in time.

This treatment closely\nparallels the corresponding development in lossless compression, a point of\nview that was advanced in an important paper of Wyner and Ziv in 1989. In the\nlossless case we review how the AEP underlies the analysis of the Lempel-Ziv\nalgorithm by viewing it as a random code and reducing it to the idealized\nShannon code. This also provides information about the redundancy of the\nLempel-Ziv algorithm and about the asymptotic behavior of several relevant\nquantities. In the lossy case we give various versions of the statement of the\ngeneralized AEP and we outline the general methodology of its proof via large\ndeviations. Its relationship with Barron's generalized AEP is also discussed.\nThe lossy AEP is applied to: (i) prove strengthened versions of Shannon's\nsource coding theorem and universal coding theorems; (ii) characterize the\nperformance of mismatched codebooks; (iii) analyze the performance of pattern-\nmatching algorithms for lossy compression; (iv) determine the first order\nasymptotics of waiting times (with distortion) between stationary processes;\n(v) characterize the best achievable rate of weighted codebooks as an optimal\nsphere-covering exponent. We then present a refinement to the lossy AEP and use\nit to: (i) prove second order coding theorems; (ii) characterize which sources\nare easier to compress; (iii) determine the second order asymptotics of waiting\ntimes; (iv) determine the precise asymptotic behavior of longest match-lengths.\nExtensions to random fields are also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2001 02:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-16"}
