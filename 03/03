The BLAGN, NELGs and galaxies have\nsimilar distributions of X-ray flux and spectra. Their ROSAT spectra are\nconsistent with their being AGN obscured by columns of 20.5<log(NH/cm^2)<23.\nThe hard spectrum BLAGN have a distribution of X-ray to optical ratios which is\nsimilar to that found for AGN from soft X-ray surveys (1<alpha_OX<2). However,\na relatively large proportion (15%) of the BLAGN, NELGs and galaxies are radio\nloud. This could be because the radio jets in these objects produce\nintrinsically hard X-ray emission, or if their hardness is due to absorption,\nit could be because radio loud objects are more X-ray luminous than radio quiet\nobjects. The 8 hard sources identified as clusters of galaxies are the\nbrightest, and softest group of sources and hence clusters are unlikely to be\nan important component of the hard, faint population. We propose that BLAGN are\nlikely to constitute a significant fraction of the faint, hard, 0.5 - 2 keV\npopulation and could be important to reproducing the shape of the X-ray\nbackground, because they are the most numerous type of object in our sample\n(comprising almost half the identified sources), and because all our high\nredshift (z>1) identified hard sources have broad lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Mar 2001 13:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Frequency entangled pulses could be used to construct\nquantum positioning systems (QPS), to perform clock synchronization, or to do\nranging (quantum radar): all of these techniques exhibit a similar enhancement\ncompared with analogous protocols that use classical light. Quantum\nentanglement and squeezing have been exploited in the context of\ninterferometry, frequency measurements, lithography, and algorithms.
