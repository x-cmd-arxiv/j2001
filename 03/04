We discuss here\nhow to derive ribbon G-categories from a simple complex Lie algebra g where G\nis the center of g. The construction is based on a study of representations of\nthe quantum group $U_q(g)$ at a root of unity. Under certain assumptions on the\nroot of unity, the resulting G-categories give rise to numerical invariants of\npairs (a closed oriented 3-manifold M, an element of $H^1(M;G)$) and to\n3-dimensional HQFT's.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Mar 2001 16:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
