When initially the core and the surface magnetic\nfield are of the same order of magnitude, the rate of flux expulsion from the\ncore is almost independent of the equation of state, and the evolution of the\nsurface field decouples from the core field evolution with increasing\nstiffness. When the surface field is initially much stronger than the core\nfield, the magnetic and rotational evolution resembles to those of a neutron\nstar with a purely crustal field configuration; the only difference is the\noccurence of a residual field. In case of an initially submerged field\nsignificant differences from the standard evolution occur only during the early\nperiod of neutron star's life, until the field has been rediffused to the\nsurface. The reminder of the episode of submergence is a correlation of the\nresidual field strength with the submergence depth of the initial field. We\ndiscuss the effect of the rediffusion of the magnetic field on to the\ndifference between the real and the active age of young pulsars and on their\nbraking indices. Finally, we estimate the shear stresses built up by the moving\nfluxoids at the crust--core interface and show that preferentially in neutron\nstars with a soft equation of state these stresses may cause crust cracking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2001 18:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The sharp peak of\n$G$ survives when the energy levels are different between the dots. When $V_{C}\n/ \\Delta > 1$, the \"molecular levels\" between the Kondo resonant states appear;\nthe Kondo resonant peaks are located below and above the Fermi level in the\nleads at low gate voltages.

The broad peak splits into two peaks when\nthe energy levels are different, reflecting the formation of the asymmetric\nmolecular levels between the Kondo resonant states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2001 06:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

For a defocusing\nnonlinearity the stability properties depend sensitively on the response\nfunction profile: for a smooth profile (e.g., a Gaussian) plane waves are\nalways stable, but MI may occur for a rectangular response. We also find that\nthe reduced model for a weak nonlocality predicts MI in defocusing media for\narbitrary response profiles, as long as the intensity exceeds a certain\ncritical value.
