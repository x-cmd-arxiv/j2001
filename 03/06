To first order\nin the perturbation expansion of the $S$-matrix we derive necessary and\nsufficient conditions for such a theory to be gauge invariant, by which we mean\nthat the gauge variation of the self-coupling with respect to the gauge charge\noperator $Q$ is a divergence in the sense of vector analysis. The most general\ntrilinear self-coupling of the graviton field turns out to be the one derived\nfrom the Einstein-Hilbert action plus coboundaries and divergences.\n  In the second part of this work (sect.9) we consider a massive scalar field\ncoupled to gravity.

Radiative corrections for two particle scattering are investigated in\nthe adiabatic limit, where the cutoff of the interaction at infinity is\nremoved.

The constructed sequence of noncommutative probability spaces\nis called the hierarchy of freeness with the corresponding states called m-free\nproducts of states. The first-order approximation corresponding to m=1 gives\nthe Boolean product of states. Thus the product states for the main types of\nnoncommutative independence can be obtained from tensor products of states.\nTherefore, this approach can be viewed as a unification of independence. We\nalso show how to associate a cocommutative *-bialgebra with the m-free product\nof states. This approach is developed in the paper for the more general case of\nthe conditionally free product of states and can be easily extended to families\nof sequences of states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2001 10:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-25"}
