We consider three\nspecific statistical measures of clustering at z=1 and z=0: the correlation\nlength (in real- and redshift-space) of galaxies of different luminosity, the\nmorphology-density relation and the genus curve of the topology of galaxy\nisodensity surfaces. For galaxies with luminosity below L*, the z=0 correlation\nlength depends very little on the luminosity of the sample, but for brighter\ngalaxies it increases very rapidly, reaching values in excess of 10Mpc/h. The\n\"accelerated\" dynamical evolution experienced by galaxies in rich clusters,\nwhich is partly responsible for this effect, also results in a strong\nmorphology-density relation. Remarkably, this relation is already\nwell-established at z=1. The genus curves of the galaxies are significantly\ndifferent from the genus curves of the dark matter but this is not due to\ngenuine topological differences but rather to the sparse sampling of the\ndensity field provided by galaxies. The predictions of our model at z=0 will be\ntested by forthcoming data from the 2dF and Sloan galaxy surveys, and those at\nz=1 by the DEEP and VIRMOS surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2001 17:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The shock is assumed to move through\na uniformly magnetized, neutral plasma consisting of protons, electrons, and\npositrons, and allowance is made for the possible production of\nelectron/positron pairs in the shock itself. The radiation mechanism is taken\nto be synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission (the latter involving both\nsynchrotron-produced and externally supplied seed photons) by the electrons and\npositrons. We simplify the discussion by considering a shock in which the\nmagnetic field is transverse to the direction of propagation and focus\nattention on the properties of the radiative zone that forms behind the shock\ntransition. In particular, we investigate the possibility that the compression\ninduced by the cooling of the gas amplifies the magnetic pressure until it\nreaches (and ultimately exceeds) equipartition with the thermal pressure\n(which, in turn, limits the overall compression). We show that, if a\nsignificant fraction of the postshock thermal energy is deposited in the\nelectron/positron component, then a considerable portion of the emitted\nradiation will come from regions of strong magnetic field even if the field\nimmediately behind the shock transition is well below equipartition. This field\namplification mechanism may be relevant to the production of synchrotron flares\nin blazars, miniquasars, and gamma-ray burst sources. We consider the latter\napplication in some detail and show that this process may play a role in the\nprompt $\\gamma$-ray and possibly also the optical ``flash'' and radio ``flare''\nemission, but probably not in the afterglow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2001 14:23:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2001 17:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Using the\nwindow-threshold technique, which is suitable for detecting weak emission\ncomponents, we have detected 4 additional emission components in the pulse\nwindow. Three of these are new components and the fourth is a confirmation of a\nrecently proposed component. Hence PSR B0329+54 is now known to have 9 emission\ncomponents - the highest among all known pulsars. The distribution of the pulse\ncomponents around the central core component indicates that the emission beam\nconsists of four nested cones. The asymmetry in the location of the conal\ncomponents in the leading versus trailing parts of the profile is interpreted\nas being due to aberration and retardation in the pulsar magnetosphere. These\nmeasurements allow us to determine the precise location of the 4 conal rings of\nemission. We find that the successive outer cones are emitted at higher\naltitudes in the magnetosphere. Further, for any given cone, the emission\nheight at the lower frequency is found to be more than that at the higher\nfrequency. The inferred heights range from ~160 km to ~1150 km. The set of\n``active'' field lines, from which most of the conal radiation appears to\noriginate, are found to be confined to a region located within ~0.5 to ~0.6 of\nthe polar cap radius.

We discuss the approximate\nexistence of a two-parameter family of ``spherical orbits'' (with constant\nradius), and, of a corresponding one-parameter family of ``last stable\nspherical orbits'' (LSSO). These orbits are of special interest for forthcoming\nLIGO/VIRGO/GEO gravitational wave observations. It is argued that for most (but\nnot all) of the parameter space of two spinning holes the effective one-body\napproach gives a reliable analytical tool for describing the dynamics of the\nlast orbits before coalescence. This tool predicts, in a quantitative way, how\ncertain spin orientations increase the binding energy of the LSSO. This leads\nto a detection bias, in LIGO/VIRGO/GEO observations, favouring spinning black\nhole systems, and makes it urgent to complete the conservative effective\none-body dynamics given here by adding (resummed) radiation reaction effects,\nand by constructing gravitational waveform templates that include spin effects.\nFinally, our approach predicts that the spin of the final hole formed by the\ncoalescence of two arbitrarily spinning holes never approaches extremality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2001 08:39:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2001 14:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

These classes are\nsuccessively embedded into each other. We show that contrary to pure W-type\nstates, the mixed W-class is not of measure zero. We construct witness\noperators that detect the class of a mixed state. We discuss the conjecture\nthat all entangled states with positive partial transpose (PPTES) belong to the\nW-class. Finally, we present a new family of PPTES \"edge\" states with maximal\nranks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2001 10:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We analyze various measures of entanglement derived from the\ngeneralized entropies of the vector of Schmidt coefficients. For N >= 3 they\ngenerate different ordering in the set of pure states and for some states their\nordering depends on the measure of entanglement used. This odd-looking property\nis acceptable, since these incomparable states cannot be transformed to each\nother with unit efficiency by any local operation. In analogy to special\nrelativity the set of pure states equivalent under local unitaries has a causal\nstructure so that at each point the set splits into three parts: the 'Future',\nthe 'Past' and the set of noncomparable states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2001 15:07:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2001 11:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
