In such\ncases, the value of Jc, called Jcm for magnetic Jc, is usually obtained from\nthe measured magnetic hysteresis loop measurements by using a proper critical\nstate model such as Bean's model (ref. 1). However, for bulk polycrystalline\nhigh temperature superconductors, the values of Jcm are much higher than the\nvalues, Jct, obtained from the transport measurements. This is due to the fact\nthat the Jct is interrupted by weakly linked grain boundaries. However, for the\nrecently discovered superconductor MgB2 (ref. 2), the grain boundary effect is\nnegligible and these two values seem to coincide. Moreover, Jc increases\ndrastically with decreasing the temperature.

Many\nnoisy signals in real systems display trends, so that the scaling results\nobtained from the DFA method become difficult to analyze. We systematically\nstudy the effects of three types of trends -- linear, periodic, and power-law\ntrends, and offer examples where these trends are likely to occur in real data.\nWe compare the difference between the scaling results for artificially\ngenerated correlated noise and correlated noise with a trend, and study how\ntrends lead to the appearance of crossovers in the scaling behavior.
