Through profile fitting and a curve-of-growth\nanalysis, we have derived rotational populations for H2 for J = 0--7. The line\nof sight has a total molecular hydrogen column density, log N(H2) = 20.68 \\pm\n0.05 cm^{-2}, nearly identical to that toward Zeta Oph, but a factor of three\nless than HD 73882. The ratio of N(J=1) to N(J=0) yields a kinetic temperature\nT_{kin} = 63 \\pm 7 K, similar to other lines of sight with A_V \\gtrsim 1. The\nhigh-J lines show considerable excitation above this temperature. The high-J\nexcitation is similar to that toward Zeta Oph, but much smaller than that\ntoward HD 73882. Chemical modeling indicates that the physical conditions in\nthe cloud(s) are very similar to those in the cloud(s) toward Zeta Oph. An\nanalysis of IUE spectra of the Lyman-alpha line gives log N(H I) = 20.85 \\pm\n0.15 cm^{-2}. Combined with N(H2), we derive a hydrogen molecular fraction,\nf_{H2} = 0.58 pm 0.12, statistically identical to that found for the lines of\nsight toward Zeta Oph and HD 73882. We also report column densities for the HD\nand CO molecules. From the combined measurements of hydrogen and carbon-\ncontaining molecules, the line of sight toward HD 110432 appears quite similar\nto the diffuse cloud line of sight toward Zeta Oph, and quite dissimilar to the\ntranslucent cloud line of sight toward HD 73882.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2001 20:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The code contains an\nequation of state which includes effects due to radiation, electrons and\nbaryons, and detailed microphysics to account for electron-positron pairs.

Calculating nh from the parabolic Tc(nh)\nbehavior, the features coalesce for all samples at nh=0.11 and nh=0.175,\nirrespective of substitution and doping. Hence, this behavior seems to reflect\nan intrinsic property of the CuO2 planes. Analyzing our results we obtain\ndifferent mechanisms in three doping regions: Tc changes in the optimally doped\nand overdoped region are mainly caused by charge transfer. In the slightly\nunderdoped region an increasing contribution to dTc/dp is obtained when well\nordered CuO chain fragments serve as pinning centers for stripes. This behavior\nis supported by our results on Zn doped NdBa2Cu3Ox and is responsible for the\nwell known dTc/dp peak observed in YBa2Cu3Ox at x=6.7. Going to a hole content\nbelow nh=0.11 our results point to a crossover from an underdoped\nsuperconductor to a doped antiferromagnet, changing completely the physics of\nthese materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2001 16:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The T-matrix (the propagator of the\nsuperconducting fluctuations) is calculated by extending the $\\acute{{\\rm\nE}}$liashberg equation. The self-energy due to the superconducting fluctuations\nis calculated by the T-matrix approximation. The pseudogap is shown in the\nsingle particle properties and the magnetic properties by the microscopic\ncalculation.

It is shown that the charge density variation\nin the vicinity of the solitary potential is a net balance of the negative\ncharge from trapped electrons and positive charge due to the decrease of the\npassing electron density. A BGK EH consists of electron density enhancements as\nwell as a density depletion, instead of only the density depletion as\npreviously thought. The shielding of the positive core is not a thermal\nscreening by the ambient plasma, but achieved by trapped electrons oscillating\ninside the potential energy trough. The total charge of a BGK EH is therefore\nzero. Two separated EHs do not interact and the concept of negative mass is not\nneeded. These features are independent of the strength of the nonlinearity. BGK\nEHs do not require thermal screening, and their size is thus not restricted to\nbe greater than the Debye length $\\lambda_D$.

However, even with these loopholes\nclosed, it does not yet follow that relativity plus quantum mechanics\nexclusively requires a field ontology, since relativistic quantum field theory\nitself might permit an ontology of localizable particles supervenient on the\nfundamental fields. Thus, we provide another no-go theorem to rule out this\npossibility.

Many physicist have regarded this\nrenunciation of our effort to describe nature herself as premature, and John\nvon Neumann reformulated quantum theory as a theory of an evolving objective\nuniverse interacting with human consciousness. This interaction is associated\nboth in Copenhagen quantum theory and in von Neumann quantum theory with a\nsudden change that brings the objective physical state of a system in line with\na subjectively felt psychical reality. The objective physical state is thereby\nconverted from a material substrate to an informational and dispositional\nsubstrate that carries both the information incorporated into it by the\npsychical realities, and certain dispositions for the occurrence of future\npsychical realities. The present work examines and proposes solutions to two\nproblems that have appeared to block the development of this conception of\nnature. The first problem is how to reconcile this theory with the principles\nof relativistic quantum field theory; the second problem is to understand\nwhether, strictly within quantum theory, a person's mind can affect the\nactivities of his brain, and if so how. Solving the first problem involves\nresolving a certain nonlocality question. The proposed solution to the second\nproblem is based on a postulated connection between effort, attention, and the\nquantum Zeno effect. This solution explains on the basis of quantum physics a\nlarge amount of heretofore unexplained data amassed by psychologists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2001 10:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
