Starting with the observed optical luminosity\nfunctions for elliptical galaxies, it is shown that the probability of an\nelliptical forming a radio source is a continuous, increasing function of\noptical luminosity, precisely proportional to square of the optical luminosity\nof the galaxy. Once the probability function is fixed, the luminosity function\nof normal elliptical galaxies is used as input for Monte Carlo simulations that\nreproduce the distribution of radio galaxies in the radio-optical luminosity\nplane. Our results show that radio galaxies are luminosity biased, but\notherwise random sample of elliptical galaxies. This unified view of radio and\nnon-radio ellipticals also explains the well known difference of 0.5 mag in\naverage optical luminosity between FRI and FRII radio galaxies as a simple\nselection effect. Specifically, FRII appear preferentially in smaller galaxies\nbecause both radio and optical luminosity functions are steep, so there is a\nnegligible probability of observing a powerful radio source associated with a\nbright galaxy; no intrinsic physical differences between FRI and FRII host\ngalaxies is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2001 18:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The propagation of cosmic antiprotons depends\non several physical characteristics of the Galaxy which are poorly known.\nAntiprotons are created from cosmic protons and helium nuclei whose fluxes were\nnot measured with great accuracy until very recently.

For example, the separation between the\nenergies of odd- and even-parity states is given at leading order by the\none-instanton contribution. However to determine the energies more accurately\nmulti-instanton configurations have also to be taken into account. We\ninvestigate here the two-instanton contributions. First we calculate\nanalytically higher-order corrections to multi-instanton effects. We then\nverify that the difference betweeen numerically determined energy eigenvalues,\nand the generalized Borel sum of the perturbation series can be described to\nvery high accuracy by two-instanton contributions. We also calculate\nhigher-order corrections to the leading factorial growth of the perturbative\ncoefficients and show that these are consistent with analytic results for the\ntwo-instanton effect and with exact data for the first 200 perturbative\ncoefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2001 18:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In particular, the formal expression $-\\Delta +\ng\\delta({\\bold x})$ corresponds to a non-trivial self-adjoint operator\n$\\hat{H}$ in the space $L^2({\\Bbb R}^d)$ only if $d\\le 3$. For spaces of larger\ndimensions (this corresponds to the strongly singular case), the construction\nof $\\hat{H}$ is much more complicated: first one should consider the space\n$L^2({\\Bbb R}^d)$ as a subspace of a wider Pontriagin space, then one\nimplicitly specifies $\\hat{H}$. It is shown in this paper that Schrodinger,\nparabolic and hyperbolic equations containing the operator $\\hat{H}$ can be\napproximated by explicitly defined systems of evolution equations of a larger\norder. The strong convergence of evolution operators taking the initial\ncondition of the Cauchy problem to the solution of the Cauchy problem is\nproved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2001 15:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
