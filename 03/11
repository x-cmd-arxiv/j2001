The non-linear optical\nproperties of polydiacetylene are considered, which are determined by the\nthird-order susceptibility.

For short chains, the\ncalculated E(1Bu) agrees with the experimental value, within solvation effects\n(ca. 0.3 eV). The charge gap is used to characterise bound and unbound states.\nThe nBu is above the charge gap and hence a continuum state; the 1Bu, 2Ag and\nmAg are not and hence are bound excitons. For large chain lengths, the nBu\ntends towards the charge gap as expected, strongly suggesting that the nBu is\nthe conduction band edge. The conduction band edge for PDA is agreed in the\nliterature to be ca. 3.0 eV.
