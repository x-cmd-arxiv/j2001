Our study extends the\nearlier work of Padmanabhan [Astrophys. J. Supp. 71, 651 (1989)] in the\nmicrocanonical ensemble. By studying the second variations of the free energy,\nwe find that instability sets in precisely at the point of minimum temperature\nin agreement with the theorem of Katz [ Mon. Not. R. astr. Soc. 183, 765\n(1978)]. The perturbation that induces instability at this point is calculated\nexplicitly; it has not a ``core-halo'' structure contrary to what happens in\nthe microcanonical ensemble. We also study Jeans type gravitational instability\nof isothermal gaseous spheres described by Navier-Stokes equations. We show\nanalytically the equivalence between dynamical stability and thermodynamical\nstability and the fact that the stability of isothermal gas spheres does not\ndepend on the viscosity. This confirms the findings of Semelin et al.\n[astro-ph/9908073] who used numerical methods. We also give a simpler\nderivation of the geometric hierarchy of scales inducing instability discovered\nby these authors. The density profiles that trigger these instabilities are\ncalculated analytically; they present more and more oscillations that also\nfollow a geometric progression. This suggests that the system will fragmentate\nin a series of `clumps' and that these `clumps' will themselves fragmentate in\nsubstructures. The fact that both the domain sizes leading to instability and\nthe `clumps' sizes within a box follow a geometric progression with the same\nratio suggests a fractal-like behaviour. This gives further support to the\ninterpretation of de Vega et al. [Nature, 383, 56 (1996)].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2001 16:30:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2001 16:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

During quiescence the accretion occurs\nvia a cool disk in the outer region but changes to a coronal flow/ADAF in the\ninner region. The transition to the coronal flow is caused by evaporation of\nmatter from the cool disk. This process is an important feature for the disk\nevolution. We point out that if the disk is depleted during the outburst, e.g.\nby irradiation, its evolution during quiescence is independent of the detailed\noutburst luminosity decline. The mass accumulation during quiescence has to\nmeet several constraints as the accretion rate, the recurrence time and the\ntotal outburst energy. We present a critical discussion of different ways to\nmodel X-ray transient outburst cycles and compare with the requirements from\nobservations.

The original mechanism of Bivacuum\nmediated Psi phenomena, proposed here, is based on few stages of my long term\nefforts. They include creation of new theories: 1) Unified theory of Bivacuum,\nmatter and fields duality, mass and charge origination as a result of Bivacuum\nfermions symmetry shift, fusion of elementary particles from sub-elementary\nfermions and dynamic mechanism of their corpuscle-wave [C - W] duality; 2) New\nquantitative Hierarchic theory of liquids and solids; 3) Elementary act of\nconsciousness or cycle of mind; 4) Theory of Virtual Replica (VR) of material\nobjects in Bivacuum (virtual hologram); 5) Theory of nonlocal Virtual Guides\n(VirG)of spin, momentum and energy - constructed from virtual Cooper pairs of\nBivacuum fermions and antifermions, interacting side-by-side. The bundles of\nVirG, connecting coherent particles of Sender (S) and Receiver (R), are\nresponsible for macroscopic entanglement and mediate different kinds of Psi\nphenomena. The 3D net of VirG forms part of Virtual Replica of any macroscopic\nobject, interacting with other objects with similar properties in non\nequilibrium conditions. The correctness of our Unified Theory (UT) follows from\nits ability to explain a lot of unconventional experimental data, like remote\nvision, mind-matter interaction, etc. without contradictions with fundamental\nlaws of nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2001 14:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2005 18:34:01 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2006 16:32:28 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2006 14:48:09 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2008 15:12:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2001 10:35:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2001 21:27:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2001 16:32:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2001 10:51:59 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2004 13:09:03 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2004 21:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2005 16:10:30 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2005 16:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-26"}
