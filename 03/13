Analogous to the\nCircumstellar Habitable Zone (CHZ), the GHZ is that region in the Milky Way\nwhere an Earth-like planet can retain liquid water on its surface and provide a\nlong-term habitat for animal-like aerobic life. In this paper we examine the\ndependence of the GHZ on Galactic chemical evolution. The single most important\nfactor is likely the dependence of terrestrial planet mass on the metallicity\nof its birth cloud. We estimate, very approximately, that a metallicity at\nleast half that of the Sun is required to build a habitable terrestrial planet.\nThe mass of a terrestrial planet has important consequences for interior heat\nloss, volatile inventory, and loss of atmosphere. A key issue is the production\nof planets that sustain plate tectonics, a critical recycling process that\nprovides feedback to stabilize atmospheric temperatures on planets with oceans\nand atmospheres. Due to the more recent decline from the early intense star\nformation activity in the Milky Way, the concentration in the interstellar\nmedium of the geophysically important radioisotopes, $^{40}$K, $^{235, 238}$U,\n$^{232}$Th, has been declining relative to Fe, an abundant element in the\nEarth. Also likely important are the relative abundances of Si and Mg to Fe,\nwhich affects the mass of the core relative to the mantle in a terrestrial\nplanet. All these elements and isotopes vary with time and location in the\nMilky Way; thus, planetary systems forming in other locations and times in the\nMilky Way with the same metallicity as the Sun will not necessarily form\nhabitable Earth-like planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2001 23:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\nsomewhat controversial scenario emerging from the comparison among various\nthermodynamical indicators is definitely better resolved relying upon a truly\ndynamical description, that points out the crucial role played by long-range\ninteractions in determining the characteristic step-wise evolution of ``good''\nfolders to their native state. It is worth stressing that this dynamical\nscenario is consistent with the information obtained by exploring the energy\nlandscapes of different sequences.

This effect is shown connected to the unphysical structure\nthat SIC generates in ensuing state-dependent radial potentials around a\nposition where the respective orbital density attains nodal zero. Non-local\nHartree-Fock that exactly eliminates the electron self-interaction is found\nentirely free from this effect. It is inferred that while SIC is largely\nunimportant in high photon-energies, any implementation of it within the local\nframe can induce unphysical oscillations in the high energy photospectra of\nmetal clusters pointing to a general need for caution in choosing appropriate\ntheoretical tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2001 16:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
