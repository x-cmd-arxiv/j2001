We suggest that a\n``decorrelation length'' can be defined as the distance over which the density\nauto-correlation function has decayed to, for example, 10% of its zero-lag\nvalue, so that the density ``events'' along a line of sight can be assumed to\nbe independent over distances larger than this, and the Central Limit Theorem\nshould be applicable. However, using random realizations of lognormal fields,\nwe show that the convergence to a Gaussian is extremely slow in the high-\ndensity tail. Thus, the column density PDF is not expected to exhibit a unique\nfunctional shape, but to transit instead from a lognormal to a Gaussian form as\nthe ratio $\\eta$ of the column length to the decorrelation length increases.\nSimultaneously, the PDF's variance decreases.

We present models which invoke simultaneous star\nformation, viscous redistribution of gas and cosmologically-motivated gaseous\ninfall and explore the predictions such models make for the scale length\nevolution and radial star formation history of galactic stellar discs. While\nthe inclusion of viscous flows is essential for ensuring that the stellar disc\nis always exponential over a significant range in radius, we find that such\nflows play essentially no role in determining the evolution of the disc scale\nlength. In models in which the main infall phase precedes the onset of star\nformation and viscous evolution, we find the exponential scale length to be\nrather invariant with time. On the other hand, models in which star\nformation/viscous evolution and infall occur concurrently result in a smoothly\nincreasing scale length with time, reflecting the mean angular momentum of\nmaterial which has fallen in at any given epoch. The disc stellar populations\nin these models are predominantly young (ie. ages < 5 Gyr) beyond a few scale\nlengths. In both cases, viscous flows are entirely responsible for transporting\nmaterial to very large radii. We discuss existing observational constraints on\nthese models from studies of both local and moderate redshift disc galaxies. In\nparticular, a good agreement is found between the solar neighbourhood star\nformation history predicted by our infall model and the recent observational\ndetermination of this quantity by Rocha-Pinto et al (2000).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2001 10:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The long time logarithmic relaxation rate\n(LTLRR), decreased from 10 K to 150 K and increased from 150 K to 195 K in\nLa0.5Ca0.5MnO3. This change in behavior was found to be related to the complete\nsuppression of the antiferromagnetic phase above 150 K and in the presence of a\n5 T magnetic field. At 195 K, the magnetization first decreased, and after a\nfew minutes increased slowly as a function of time. Moreover, between 200 K and\n245 K, the magnetization increased throughout the measured time span. The\nchange in the slope of the curves, from negative to positive at about 200 K was\nfound to be related to the suppression of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in\nsmall magnetic fields. A similar temperature dependence of the LTLRR was found\nfor the Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3 sample.
