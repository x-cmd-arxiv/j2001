Some large (50-pc scale) line emitting\nregions have little associated continuum emission, but a Pa equivalent width\nindicating a few-Myr-old embedded stellar population. The Ha/Pa intensity\nratios suggest the gas is mixed with dust, making it effective at obscuring\nsome of the young clusters. We identify about 1000 compact continuum sources\n(super star clusters and individual stars) and analyze their spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) from 0.2 to 1.6 micron by fitting them with a grid of\nspectral synthesis models with a range of ages and extinctions. Most of the\nvisible clusters are only mildly reddened, with A_V=0 to 1 mag, suggesting that\nthe processes that clear out the gas and dust of the stellar birth clouds are\nefficient and fast. The patchiness of the dust distribution makes it difficult\nto estimate reliably the star formation rate, based on UV continuum slope or\nhydrogen emission-line ratios. The cluster SEDs are consistent with a range in\nages, from 1 Myr to 300 Myr, but with only a minority older than a few tens of\nMyr. However, after accounting for an age bias, the fraction of old clusters is\nconsistent with continuous star formation in the rings over the past ~300 Myr.\nSome of the brightest young clusters have excess emission in the IR that may be\nradiation by circumstellar dust. The cluster mass functions follow an m^-2\npower-law distribution, distinct from those of old globular clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2001 17:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

To\nclarify the first issue, we establish two independent methods for estimating a\nparameter of LCE ($f$), which is defined as the fraction of Lyman continuum\nphotons contributing to hydrogen ionization in an H {\\sc ii} region. One of\nthose methods determines $f$ from the set of Lyman continuum flux, electron\ndensity and metallicity. In the framework of this method, as the metallicity\nand/or the Lyman photon flux increase, $f$ is found to decrease. The other\nmethod determines $f$ from the ratio of infrared flux to Lyman continuum flux.\nImportantly, we show that $f \\la 0.5$ via both methods in many H {\\sc ii}\nregions of the Galaxy. Thus, it establishes that dust in such H {\\sc ii}\nregions absorbs significant amount of Lyman continuum photons directly.

It is now clear that the hosts of radio-loud and\nradio-quiet quasars with M_V < -23.5 are virtually all massive elliptical\ngalaxies. The masses of these spheroids are as expected given the relationship\nbetween black-hole and spheroid mass found for nearby quiescent galaxies, as is\nthe growing prevalence of disc components in the hosts of progressively fainter\nAGN. There is also now compelling evidence that quasar hosts are practically\nindistinguishable from normal ellipticals, both in their basic structural\nparameters and in the old age of their dominant stellar populations; at low z\nthe nuclear activity is not associated with the formation of a significant\nfraction of the host galaxy.

Meanwhile, taking account of the\nindeterministic aspect of the quantum description of matter, which manifests\nitself in quantum jumps, essentially affects classical spacetime structure and\nthe Einstein equation. Quantum jumps give rise to a family of sets of\nsimultaneous events, which implies the existence of universal cosmological\ntime. In view of the jumps, the requirement for metric and its time derivative\nto be continuous implies that the Einstein equation should involve pseudomatter\nalong with matter. Pseudomatter manifests itself only in gravitational effects,\nbeing thereby an absolutely dark ``matter''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2001 03:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Considering an extreme Kerr black hole, we show that the large\nnumber of virtually undamped quasinormal modes (that exist for nonzero values\nof the azimuthal eigenvalue m) combine in such a way that the field (as\nobserved at infinity) oscillates with an amplitude that decays as 1/t at late\ntimes. This is in clear contrast with the standard late time power-law fall-off\nfamiliar from studies of non-rotating black holes. This long-lived oscillating\n``tail'' will, however, not be present for non-extreme (presumably more\nastrophysically relevant) black holes, for which we find that many quasinormal\nmodes (individually excited to a very small amplitude) combine to give rise to\nan exponentially decaying field. This result could have implications for the\ndetection of gravitational-wave signals from rapidly spinning black holes,\nsince the required theoretical templates need to be constructed from linear\ncombinations of many modes. Our main results are obtained analytically, but we\nsupport the conclusions with numerical time-evolutions of the Teukolsky\nequation. These time-evolutions provide an interesting insight into the notion\nthat the quasinormal modes can be viewed as waves trapped in the spacetime\nregion outside the horizon. They also suggest that a plausible mechanism for\nthe behaviour we observe for extreme black holes is the presence of a\n``superradiance resonance cavity'' immediately outside the black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2001 11:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Amosov, Holevo\nand Werner have also conjectured that the maximal p-norm of a product channel\nis achieved with product input states. In this paper we establish both of these\nconjectures in the case that \\Omega is arbitrary and \\Phi is a CQ or QC channel\n(as defined by Holevo). We also establish the Amosov, Holevo and Werner\nconjecture when \\Omega is arbitrary and either \\Phi is a qubit channel and p=2,\nor \\Phi is a unital qubit channel and p is integer. Our proofs involve a new\nconjecture for the norm of an output state of the half-noisy channel I \\otimes\n\\Phi, when \\Phi is a qubit channel. We show that this conjecture in some cases\nalso implies additivity of the Holevo capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2001 02:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
