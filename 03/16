The technique\nutilizes the fact that Monte Carlo simulations track individual photon packets,\nso we may easily determine where their energy is absorbed. When a packet is\nabsorbed, it heats a particular cell within the envelope, raising its\ntemperature. To enforce radiative equilibrium, the absorbed packet is\nimmediately re-emitted. To correct the cell temperature, the frequency of the\nre-emitted packet is chosen so that it corrects the temperature of the spectrum\npreviously emitted by the cell. The re-emitted packet then continues being\nscattered, absorbed, and re-emitted until it finally escapes from the envelope.\nAs the simulation runs, the envelope heats up, and the emergent spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) relaxes to its equilibrium value, without iteration. This\nimplies that the equilibrium temperature calculation requires no more\ncomputation time than the SED calculation of an equivalent pure scattering\nmodel with fixed temperature. In addition to avoiding iteration, our method\nconserves energy exactly, because all injected photon packets eventually\nescape. Furthermore, individual packets transport energy across the entire\nsystem because they are never destroyed. This long-range communication, coupled\nwith the lack of iteration, implies that our method does not suffer the\nconvergence problems commonly associated with lambda-iteration.

In addition, whereas G and early K\nstars in the two clusters are, on average, more Li rich than their counterparts\nin the Pleiades, a fraction of the coolest stars, in particular in IC 2391, are\nas depleted as as the lowest-Li Pleiades stars of the same mass.

In this paper we discuss\nthe interpretation of modern realizations of the Michelson-Morley experiment in\nthe context of a new model of electrodynamics featuring a vector-valued photon\nmass. This model is gauge invariant, unlike massive-photon theories based on\nthe Proca equation, and it predicts anisotropy of both the speed of light and\nthe electric field of a point charge. The latter leads to an orientation\ndependence of the length of solid bodies which must be accounted for when\ninterpreting the results of a Michelson-Morley experiment. Using a simple model\nof ionic solids we show that, in principle, the effect of orientation dependent\nlength can conspire to cancel the effect of an anisotropic speed of light in a\nMichelson-Morley experiment, thus, complicating the interpretation of the\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2001 17:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In this paper, we generalize this\nmodel in two different ways. First, we consider partially reflecting mirrors.\nWe show that the Bogoliubov coefficients relating inertial modes can be\nexpressed in terms of the frequency dependent reflection factor which is\nspecified in the rest frame of the mirror and the transformation from the\ninertial modes to the modes at rest with respect to the mirror. In this\nperspective, the DF model is simply the limiting case when this factor is unity\nfor all frequencies. In the second part, we introduce an alternative model\nwhich is based on self-interactions described by an action principle. When the\ncoupling is constant, this model can be solved exactly and gives rise to a\npartially reflecting mirror. The usefulness of this dynamical model lies in the\npossibility of switching off the coupling between the mirror and the field.\nThis allows to obtain regularized expressions for the fluxes in situations\nwhere they are singular when using the DF model. Two examples are considered.\nThe first concerns the flux induced by the disappearance of the reflection\ncondition, a situation which bears some analogies with the end of the\nevaporation of a black hole.

We introduce a new method of obtaining a tensor\nbasis with appropriate Lorentz-invariant amplitudes which are free from\nkinematical singularities and constraints. We then motivate a gauge-invariant\nseparation into a generalized Born term containing ground-state properties\nonly, and a residual contribution describing the model-dependent internal\nstructure. The generalized dipole polarizabilities are defined in terms of\nLorentz-invariant residual amplitudes. Particular emphasis is laid on a\nphysical interpretation of these quantities as characterizing the spatial\ndistributions of the induced electric polarization and magnetization of\nhadrons. It is argued that three dipole polarizabilities, namely the\nlongitudinal electric alpha_L(q^2), the transverse electric alpha_T(q^2), and\nthe magnetic beta(q^2) ones are required in order to fully reconstruct local\npolarizations induced by soft external fields in a hadron.

We consider the case when the symmetry is\nrepresented by a quantum number that takes one of two possible values, so that\nthe unperturbed system has a spectrum composed of two independent sequences.\nWhen symmetry-breaking perturbation is represented by a random matrix with an\nadjustable strength, the shape of the spectrum monotonously evolves towards the\nWigner distribution as the strength parameter increases. This contradicts the\nobserved behaviour of the acoustic resonance spectra in quartz blocks during\nthe breaking of a point-group symmetry that has two eigenvalues, where the\nsystem changes in the beginning towards the Poisson statistics then turns back\nto the GOE statistics. This behaviour is explained by assuming that the\nsymmetry breaking perturbation removes the degeneracy of a limited number of\nlevels, thus creating a third chaotic sequence.

The view presented is that we are entitled to\nuse `many-worlds' terminology even if the theory does not specify the worlds in\nthe formalism; this is defended by means of an extensive analogy with the\nconcept of an `instant' or moment of time in relativity, with the lack of a\npreferred foliation of spacetime being compared with the lack of a preferred\nbasis in quantum theory. Implications for identity of worlds over time, and for\nrelativistic quantum mechanics, are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2001 12:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It shows in particular how the band\nspectrum of the infinite periodic system arises in the limit $N\\to\\infty$. We\nillustrate the result on two kinds of examples. The first are serial graphs\nobtained by chaining loops or T-junctions. A detailed discussion is presented\nfor a finite-periodic \"comb\"; we show how the resonance poles can be computed\nwithin the Krein formula approach. Another example concerns geometric\nscatterers where the individual element consists of a surface with a pair of\nleads; we show that apart of the resonances coming from the decoupled-surface\neigenvalues such scatterers exhibit the high-energy behavior typical for the\ndelta' interaction for the physically interesting couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2001 14:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
