We review our scheme that hides one bit between\ntwo parties using Bell states, and we derive upper and lower bounds on the\nsecrecy of the hiding scheme. We provide an explicit bound showing that\nmultiple bits can be hidden bitwise with our scheme. We give a preparation of\nthe hiding states as an efficient quantum computation that uses at most one\nebit of entanglement. A candidate data hiding scheme that does not use\nentanglement is presented. We show how our scheme for quantum data hiding can\nbe used in a conditionally secure quantum bit commitment scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2001 22:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

In the other experiment,\nnot only they are in disagreement at the individual level, but their\nequivalence at the statistical level also breaks down, if one uses selective\ndetection.
