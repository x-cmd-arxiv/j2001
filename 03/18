It is shown that at the latitude of Obninsk within a 24-hour\nobservation period the horizontal projection of aether wind velocity varies\nfrom 140 km/s to 480 km/s. The second version of this paper (arXiv:\n1003.2899v2, 15.04.2010) is supplemented with a second method of finding the\nvelocity of the aether wind -- through measuring the largest seasonal decrease\nin the ratio of the summer shift of the interference fringe to the winter one\n(equaled ~12%). It gave the same interval of values of the projections of the\naether wind velocity as the first method. More than hundred years there\npersists a belief that Michelson-type interferometer can not be adjusted such\nas to detect effects of the first order with respect to v/c. Below I show that\nit is possible, and more successfully than on the interferometer of the second\norder. In contrast to the traditional approach, in the interferometer of the\nfirst order the light after splitting on a semi-transparent plate propagates in\nboth arms to the reflecting mirrors in one optical medium, and returns after\nreflection from the mirrors through another optical medium. The shift of the\ninterference fringe was found to be proportional to the difference of\ndielectric permittivities of these media. The horizontal projection of the\nEarth's velocity relative to luminiferous aether measured by the first order\ninterferometer agrees with that found by the first two methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2001 22:05:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2001 21:51:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2010 14:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-20"}
