The\nX-ray image shows the nucleus, southern extranuclear cloud, and northern loop,\nthe morphology of the extended emission being very similar to those seen in\nradio continuum and optical emission line images. The X-ray spectrum of the\nnucleus is well represented by a model consisting of soft thermal plasma with\nkT ~0.5 keV, a very hard continuum, and an Fe Kalpha emission line at 6.45 keV\nwith an equivalent width of >2 keV. The very strong Fe line and the flat\ncontinuum indicate that the nucleus is obscured by a column density in excess\nof 10^24 cm^-2 and the spectrum is dominated by reflected emission from cold\nmatter near the nucleus. The X-ray spectra of the extranuclear clouds are well\nfitted by a thermal plasma model with kT ~0.5 keV. This spectral shape and\nmorphology strongly suggest that the clouds are shock heated by the bi-polar\noutflow from the nucleus. The shock velocities of the extranuclear cloud and\nnorthern loop inferred from the temperatures of the X-ray gas are 690 km/s and\n660 km/s, respectively. By assuming a steady-state situation in which the\nemission of the extranuclear clouds is powered by the jets, the mechanical\nenergy in the jets is found to be comparable to the bolometric luminosity of\nthe nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2001 06:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Ground-based\nnear-infrared photometry, data obtained by IRAS and kinematic data from the\nliterature are combined to investigate the properties of these stars. The light\namplitude in the near-infrared is found to be correlated with period, and this\namplitude decreases with increasing wavelength. Statistical tests show that\nthere is no reason to suspect any difference in the period distributions of the\ncarbon- and oxygen-rich stars for periods less than 1000 days, and no\ncarbon-rich star has a period longer than 1000 days. The colours are consistent\nwith those of cool stars with evolved circumstellar dust-shells. Luminosities\nand distances are estimated using a period-luminosity relation.

The kinematics and\nscale-height of the sample shows that the sources with periods less than 1000\ndays must have low mass main-sequence progenitors. It is argued that the three\noxygen-rich stars with periods over 1000 days probably had intermediate mass\nmain-sequence progenitors with remaining stars having an average progenitor\nmass of about 1.3 solar masses. The average lifetime of stars in this phase is\nestimated to be about 4.0E4 years, indicating they will undergo at most one\nmore thermal pulse before leaving the AGB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2001 15:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The resulting energy-dependent profiles are characterized by a\ndipole-resonant peak and higher energy fine structure. The polarization\ndependence is predominantly $\\sigma$-to-$\\pi$ and the azimuthal dependence\nfollows a sin-squared behavior. These results are similar to those obtained in\nrecent x-ray scattering studies of orbital ordering carried out in these same\nmaterials at the Mn K edge. They lead to a description of the cross-section in\nterms of Templeton scattering in which the tilt ordering breaks the symmetry at\nthe rare earth site. The most interesting result of the present work is our\nobservation that octahedral tilt ordering persists above the orbital ordering\ntransition temperatures in all three samples. Indeed, we identify separate\nstructural transitions which may be associated with the onset of orbital and\ntilt ordering, respectively, and characterize the loss of tilt ordering versus\ntemperature in LaMnO$_3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2001 10:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Alternatively, it is possible\nto restore the original value of the variable by feedback. In this paper, we\ndescribe a quantum nondemolition measurement of a quadrature component of the\nlight field using a feedback compensated beam splitter. The noise induced by\nthe vacuum port of the beam splitter is compensated by a linear feedback\nresulting in an effective amplification of the observed variable. This\namplification is then be reversed by optical parametric amplification to\nrestore the original value of the field component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2001 08:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

After an introduction of all the necessary quantum\nmechanical and information theoretical concepts we analyze Landauer's principle\nthat states that the erasure of information is inevitably accompanied by the\ngeneration of heat. We employ this principle to rederive a number of results in\nclassical and quantum information theory whose rigorous mathematical\nderivations are difficult. This demonstrates the usefulness of Landauer's\nprinciple and provides an introduction to the physical theory of information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2001 14:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
