The latter have been characterized by simple systems of axioms\nwith a combinatorial-geometric flavour. Similar to buildings geometries can be\nassociated with finite sporadic simple groups (FSSGs). However, most of the\nknown characterizations of such geometries for FSSGs require additional\nassumptions of a group-theoretic nature. One aim of this thesis is to present\ncharacterizations of geometries for FSSGs J_2, Suz, McL, Co_3, Fi(22), Fi(23),\nFi(24) and He, which are in the same spirit as the characterizations of\nbuildings and polar spaces mentioned above, in particular without any\nassumption on the automorphism groups of the geometries. A by-product of these\nresults for J_2, Suz and He is a proof that certain presentations for those\ngroups are faithful. Most of this work may be viewed as a contribution to the\ntheory of graphs with prescribed neighbourhood. The result on graphs of\n(+)-points of GF(3)-orthogonal spaces, which is also used for characterization\nof geometries for Fi(22), Fi(23) and Fi(24), may be considered as a\ngeneralization of a well-known theorem on locally co-triangular graphs.\nHyperovals of polar spaces are natural generalizations of hyperovals of\nprojective planes of even order and play an important role in investigations of\nextensions of polar spaces.
