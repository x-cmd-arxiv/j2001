Their light curves suggest that the gamma-ray emission\noccurs at early stages of the ejecta expansion, well before it decelerates in\nthe ambient medium. If so, the launched gamma-ray front must overtake the\nejecta and sweep the ambient medium outward. As a result a gap is opened\nbetween the ejecta and the medium that surfs the radiation front ahead.\nEffectively, the ejecta moves in a cavity until it reaches a radius\nR_{gap}=10^{16}E_{54}^{1/2} cm where E is the isotropic energy of the GRB. At\nR=R_{gap} the gap is closed, a blast wave forms and collects the medium swept\nby radiation. Further development of the blast wave is strongly affected by the\nleading radiation front: the front plays the role of a precursor where the\nmedium is loaded with e+- pairs and preaccelerated just ahead of the blast. It\nimpacts the emission from the blast at R < R_{load}=5R_{gap} (the early\nafterglow). A spectacular observational effect results: GRB afterglows should\nstart in optical/UV and evolve fast (< min) to a normal X-ray afterglow. The\nearly optical emission observed in GRB 990123 may be explained in this way. The\nimpact of the front is especially strong if the ambient medium is a wind from a\nmassive progenitor of the GRB.

The origin of this field has not as yet been explained\nin a fully satisfactory way and represents one of the main challenges of the\nastrophysical dynamo theory. In both the galactic dynamo theory and the\nprimordial-origin theory, a major influence is exerted by the small-scale\nmagnetic fluctuations. This article is devoted to constructing a systematic\nsecond-order statistical theory of such small-scale fields. The statistics of\nthese fields are studied in the kinematic approximation and for the case of\nlarge Prandtl numbers, which is relevant for the galactic and protogalactic\nplasma. The advecting velocity field is assumed to be Gaussian and short-time\ncorrelated. Theoretical understanding of this kinematic dynamo model is a\nnecessary prerequisite for any prospective nonlinear dynamo theory. The theory\nis developed for an arbitrary degree of compressibility and formally in d\ndimensions, which generalizes the previously known results, elicits the\nstructure of the solutions, and uncovers a number of new effects. The magnetic\nenergy spectra are studied as they grow and spread over scales during the\ninitial stage of the field amplification. Exact Green's-function solutions are\nobtained. The spectral theory is supplemented by the study of magnetic-field\ncorrelation functions in the configuration space, where the dynamo problem can\nbe mapped onto a particular one-dimensional quantum-mechanical problem. The\nlatter approach is most suitable for the description of the kinematic dynamo in\nthe long-time limit, i.e. when the magnetic excitation has spread over all\nscales present in the system. A simple way of calculating the growth rates of\nthe magnetic fields in this long-time limit is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2001 09:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2002 22:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We use the metrics to construct new\nsupersymmetric brane solutions in M-theory and string theory. In particular, we\nconstruct resolved fractional M2-branes involving the use of the L^2 harmonic\n4-forms, and show that for each manifold there is a supersymmetric example. An\nintriguing feature of the new A_8 and B_8 Spin(7) metrics is that they are\nactually the same local solution, with the two different complete manifolds\ncorresponding to taking the radial coordinate to be either positive or\nnegative. We make a comparison with the Taub-NUT and Taub-BOLT metrics, which\nby contrast do not have special holonomy. In an appendix we construct the\ngeneral solution of our first-order equations for Spin(7) holonomy, and obtain\nfurther regular metrics that are complete on manifolds B^+_8 and B^-_8 similar\nto B_8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2001 23:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2001 22:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

In present work is shown, that if to use more physical and weak\ncondition of universality (suggested already in earliest work by D.Deutsch\n1985) and to talk about simulation with arbitrary, but finite precision, then\nit is possible to build universal programmable gate array. But now the same\nno-go theorem by Nielsen and Chuang will have new interesting consequence ---\ncontrolling programs for the gate arrays can be considered as pure classical.\nMore detailed design of such deterministic quantum gate arrays universal ``in\napproximate sense'' is considered in the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2001 22:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
