We have analyzed\nthe stellar and gas mass functions of the first massive luminous objects formed\nin a \\Lambda CDM universe, as calculated in the numerical simulation described\nin Gnedin (2000ab).

Moreover, while\nthe gas mass function follows the dark matter mass function until reionization\nat z~7, between z=7 and z=4, the gas mass function also flattens considerably\nat the low mass end. At z=4, the gas and stellar mass functions are fit by a\nSchechter function with \\alpha ~ -1.2 +/- 0.1, significantly shallower than the\ndark matter halo mass function and consistent with some recent observations.\nThe baryonic mass functions are shallower because (a) the dark matter halo mass\nfunction is consistent with the Press-Schechter formulation at low masses n(M)\n  M^-2 and (b) heating/cooling and ionization processes appear to cause baryons\nto collect in halos with the relationship M_b M_d^4 at low masses.

Different\npostulates based on the Sagnac experiment are proposed, and from these\npostulates a new relativistic theory of rotating frames is developed following\nsteps similar to those initially followed by Einstein for rectilinear motion.\nThe resulting theory agrees with all experiments, resolves problems with the\ntraditional approach to the rotating disk, and exhibits both traditionally\nrelativistic and non-relativistic characteristics. Of particular note, no\nLorentz contraction exists on the rotating disk circumference, and the disk\nsurface, contrary to the assertions of Einstein and others, is found to be\nRiemann flat. The variable speed of light found in the Sagnac experiment is\nthen shown to be characteristic of non-time-orthogonal reference frames, of\nwhich the rotating frame is one. In addition, the widely accepted postulate for\nthe equivalence of inertial and non-inertial standard rods with zero relative\nvelocity, used liberally in prior rotating disk analyses, is shown to be\ninvalid for such frames. Further, the new theory stands alone in correctly\npredicting what was heretofore considered a \"spurious\" non-null effect on the\norder of 10^-13 found by Brillet and Hall in the most accurate Michelson-Morley\ntype test to date. The presentation is simple and pedagogic in order to make it\naccessible to the non-specialist.\n  Key words: relativistic, rotating disk, Sagnac, rotating frame,\nnon-time-orthogonal frame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2001 03:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
