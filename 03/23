Consequently, we have essentially two rigid solids, for which\nthe forces at randomly distributed \"pinning sites\" cancel.

Moreover, this function satisfies the dispersionless Hirota equation for\n2D Toda lattice hierarchy.\n  Thus for an effectivisation of Riemann theorem it is sufficiently to find a\nrepresentation of $v$ in the form of Taylor series $v=\\sum N(i_0 | i_1,...,i_k|\n\\bar i_1,...,\\bar i_{\\bar k})t_0 t_{i_1},...,t_k \\bar t_{\\bar i_1},...,\\bar\nt_{\\bar i_{\\bar k}}$.

This result means that one can make predictions\nregarding mutually exclusive features of a physical existent. It is important\nto ask whether people have the capacity to make observations of mutually\nexclusive phenomena. Our everyday experience informs us that a human observer\nis capable of observing only one set of physical circumstances at a time.\nEvidence from psychology, though, indicates that people may have the capacity\nto make observations of mutually exclusive physical phenomena, even though this\ncapacity is not generally recognized. Working independently, Sigmund Freud and\nWilliam James provided some of this evidence.

This is due to a very high level density of\nmany-body states that are easily mixed by a residual interaction between\nparticles (quasi-particles). For such systems, we have derived simple\nanalytical expressions for the time dependence of energy width of wave packets,\nas well as for the entropy, number of principal basis components and inverse\nparticipation ratio, and tested them in numerical experiments. It is shown that\nthe energy width $\\Delta (t)$ increases linearly and very quickly saturates.\nThe entropy of a system increases quadratically, $S(t) \\sim t^2$ at small\ntimes, and after, can grow linearly, $S(t) \\sim t$, before the saturation.\nCorrespondingly, the number of principal components determined by the entropy,\n$N_{pc} \\sim exp{(S(t))}$, or by the inverse participation ratio, increases\nexponentially fast before the saturation. These results are explained in terms\nof a cascade model which describes the flow of excitation in the Fock space of\nbasis components. Finally, a striking phenomenon of damped oscillations in the\nFock space at the transition to an equilibrium is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2001 01:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

A general case\nof unequal oscillator strengths of the transitions is considered. Durations of\nthe probe pulse and the coupling pulse $T_{1,2}$ ($T_2>T_1$) are assumed to be\nshorter than any of the relevant atomic relaxation times. We propose analytical\nand numerical solutions of a self-consistent set of coupled Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequations and reduced wave equations in the adiabatic limit with the account of\nthe first non-adiabatic correction. The adiabaticity criterion is also\ndiscussed with the account of the pulse propagation. The dynamics of\npropagation is found to be strongly dependent on the ratio of the transition\noscillator strengths. It is shown that envelopes of the pulses slightly change\nthroughout the medium length at the initial stage of propagation. This distance\ncan be large compared to the one-photon resonant absorption length. Eventually,\nthe probe pulse is completely reemitted into the coupling pulse during\npropagation.
