Acceptable coeval fits are found for sixteen pairs without optimizing\nfor heavy element or helium abundance. The precision of these tests is limited\nby the accuracies of the observed effective temperatures. High dispersion\nspectra and detailed atmospheric modeling should give more accurate effective\ntemperatures and heavy element abundances. PV Cas, a peculiar early A system,\nEK Cep B, a known post-T Tauri star, and RS Cha, a member of a young OB\nassociation, are matched by pre-main sequence models. Predicted mass loss\nagrees with upper limits from IUE for CW Cep A and B. Relatively poor fits are\nobtained for binaries having at least one component in the mass range 1.7 <\nM/M_sol <2.6, whose evolution is sensitive to mixing. These discrepancies are\nrobust and consistent with additional mixing in real stars. The predicted\napsidal motion implies that massive star models are systematically less\ncentrally condensed than the real stars. If these effects are due to\novershooting, then the overshooting parameter alpha_OV increases with stellar\nmass. The apsidal motion constants are controlled by radiative opacity under\nconditions close to those directly measured in laser experiments, making this\ntest more stringent than possible before.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2001 18:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The relative\ndifferences that have been previously detected in 2-D simulations involving\ndistinct magnetic field configurations are diminished in the 3-D flows. While\nthe presence of toroidal magnetic components can modify the morphology close to\nthe jet head inhibiting its fragmentation in the early jet evolution, as\npreviously reported in the literature, the impact of the pulsed-induced\ninternal knots causes the appearance of a complex morphology at the jet head\n(as required by the observations of H-H jets) even in the MHD jet models with\ntoroidal components. The detailed structure and emission properties of the\ninternal working surfaces can be also significantly altered by the presence of\nmagnetic fields. The increase of the magnetic field strength improves the jet\ncollimation, and amplifies the density (by factors up to 1.4, and 4) and the\nH\\alpha$ intensity (by factors up to 4, and 5) behind the knots of jets with\nhelical field and $\\beta \\simeq 1-0.1$ (respectively), relative to a non\nmagnetic jet. As a consequence, the corresponding $I_{[SII]}}/I_{H}\\alpha}$\nratio (which is frequently used to determine the excitation level of HH\nobjects) can be decreased in the MHD models with toroidal components relative\nto non-magnetic calculations. We also find that the helical mode of the K-H\ninstability can be triggered in MHD models with helical magnetic fields,\ncausing some jet wiggling.

Due to the large\nsingle-particle level density, shell corrections in the superheavy elements\ndiffer markedly from those in lighter nuclei. With increasing proton and\nneutron numbers, the regions of nuclei stabilized by shell effects become\npoorly localized in particle number, and the familiar pattern of shells\nseparated by magic gaps is basically gone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2001 00:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In the context of dynamical systems, Grassberger\nhas suggested that a slow approach of the entropy to its extensive asymptotic\nlimit is a sign of complexity. We investigate this idea further by information\ntheoretic and statistical mechanics techniques and show that these arguments\ncan be made precise, and that they generalize many previous approaches to\ncomplexity, in particular unifying ideas from the physics literature with ideas\nfrom learning and coding theory; there are even connections of this statistical\napproach to algorithmic or Kolmogorov complexity. Moreover, a set of simple\naxioms similar to those used by Shannon in his development of information\ntheory allows us to prove that the divergent part of the subextensive component\nof the entropy is a unique complexity measure. We classify time series by their\ncomplexities and demonstrate that beyond the `logarithmic' complexity classes\nwidely anticipated in the literature there are qualitatively more complex,\n`power--law' classes which deserve more attention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2001 16:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
