For radially streaming\nradiation, line forces are only effective if there is a strong radial velocity\ngradient, as occurs, for example, in a line-driven stellar wind. However,\nwithin an orbiting disk, the radial shear of the azimuthal velocity leads to\nstrong line-of-sight velocity velocity gradients along nonradial directions. As\nsuch, in the proximity of a stellar surface extending over a substantial cone\nangle, the nonradial stellar radiation can impart a significant line force,\neven in the case of purely circular orbits. Given the highly supersonic nature\nof orbital velocity variations, we use the Sobolev approximation, thereby\nextending to the disk case the standard CAK formalism developed for line-driven\nwinds. We delineate the parameter regimes for which radiative forces might\nalter disk properties; but even when radiative forces are small, we\nanalytically quantify higher-order effects in the linear limit, including the\nprecession of weakly elliptical orbits. We find that optically thick line\nforces can have observable implications for the dynamics of disks around Be\nstars, including the generation of either prograde or retrograde precession in\nslightly eccentric orbits. However, our analysis suggests a net retrograde\neffect, in apparent contradiction with observed long-term variations of\nviolet/red line profile asymmetries from Be stars, which are generally thought\nto result from prograde propagation of a so-called ``one arm mode''. We also\nconclude that radiative forces may alter the dynamical properties at the\nsurface of the disk where disk winds originate, and may even make low-density\ndisks vulnerable to being blown away.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2001 01:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
