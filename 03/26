The X-ray spectra of\nthese sources show an absorption column of (1-3) x 10^23 H cm-2. Assuming a\nmoderate temperature plasma, the X-ray luminosity in the 0.5-10 keV band is\nestimated to be ~10^30 erg s^-1 at a distance of 450 pc.

The extremely high absorption of 3 x 10^23 H cm^-2 indicates\nthat the source must be surrounded by dense gas, suggesting that it is either a\nYSO in an early accretion phase or a Type II AGN (e.g. a Seyfert 2), although\nno counterpart is found at any other wavelength.

For example, the study of the echoes produced by a large\nnumber of particle insonified by pulsed wavetrains has led to a now standard\nvelocimetry technique. In this paper, we propose to extend the method to the\ncontinuous tracking of one single particle embedded in a complex flow. This\ngives a Lagrangian measurement of the fluid motion, which is of importance in\nmixing and turbulence studies. The method relies on the ability to resolve in\ntime the Doppler shift of the sound scattered by the continuously insonfied\nparticle.\n  For this signal processing problem two classes of approaches are used:\ntime-frequency analysis and parametric high resolution methods. In the first\nclass we consider the spectrogram and reassigned spectrogram, and we apply it\nto detect the motion of a small bead settling in a fluid at rest. In more\nnon-stationary turbulent flows where methods in the second class are more\nrobust, we have adapted an Approximated Maximum Likelihood technique coupled\nwith a generalized Kalman filter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2001 15:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
