In the\nresulting collisions shocks develop, converting some of the ordered bulk\nkinetic energy into magnetic field and random energy of the electrons which\nthen radiate. We propose that this internal shock scenario, which is the\nscenario generally thought to explain the observed gamma-ray burst radiation,\ncan work also for radio sources in general, and for blazar in particular. We\ninvestigate in detail this idea, simulating the birth, propagation and\ncollision of shells, calculating the spectrum produced in each collision, and\nsumming the locally produced spectra from those regions of the jet which are\nsimultaneously active in the observer's frame. We can thus construct snapshots\nof the overall spectral energy distribution as well as time dependent spectra\nand light curves.

Since the\nemission from the optical afterglow is thought to be more isotropic than the\ngamma-ray emission, it has been hypothesized that a search for orphan\nafterglows (those without the triggering GRB) would allow strong constraints to\nbe placed on the degree of GRB collimation. We show here that, within the\ncontext of leading models of GRB jet evolution, measurement of the GRB beaming\nangle using optical orphan searches is extremely difficult, perhaps impossible\nin practice. This is because in the leading model of GRB jets, the effective\nafterglow beaming angle scales with the jet angle for small angles, and so the\nratio of detected orphan afterglows to GRBs is independent of the jet opening\nangle. Thus, the number of expected afterglow detections is the same for\nmoderate jet angles (e.g. 20 deg) as for arbitrarily small jet angles (<< 0.1\ndeg). For nearly isotropic GRB geometry, or for radio afterglow searches in\nwhich the jet has become non-relativistic, the ratio of afterglows to GRBs may\ngive information on collimation. However, using a simple model we estimate the\nexpected number of orphan detections in current supernova surveys, and find\nthis number to be less than one, for all jet opening angles. Even for future\nsupernova surveys, the small detection rate and lack of dependence on\ncollimation angle appear to ruin the prospects of determining GRB beaming by\nthis method.

But of course, it is not sharp for many Riemannian manifolds,\ne.g. flat tori $\\R^n/\\Gamma$. We say that $S^n$, but not $\\R^n/\\Gamma$, is a\nRiemannian manifold with maximal eigenfunction growth. The problem which\nmotivates this paper is to determine the $(M, g)$ with maximal eigenfunction\ngrowth. Our main result is that such an $(M, g)$ must have a point $x$ where\nthe set ${\\mathcal L}_x$ of geodesic loops at $x$ has positive measure in\n$S^*_x M$. We show that if $(M, g)$ is real analytic, this puts topological\nrestrictions on $M$, e.g. only $M = S^2$ (topologically) in dimension 2 can\npossess a real analytic metric of maximal eigenfunction growth. We further show\nthat generic metrics on any $M$ fail to have maximal eigenfunction growth. In\naddition, we construct an example of $(M, g)$ for which ${\\mathcal L}_x$ has\npositive measure for an open set of $x$ but which does not have maximal\neigenfunction growth, thus disproving a naive converse to the main result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2001 20:40:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 May 2001 14:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

A necessary\ningredient of this method is the notion of free vertex algebra. Borcherds\n\\cite{bor} was the first to note that free vertex algebras do not exist in\ngeneral. The reason for this is that vertex algebras do not form a variety of\nalgebras, because the locality axiom (see sec 2 below) is not an identity.\nHowever, a certain subcategory of vertex algebras, obtained by restricting the\norder of locality of generators, has a universal object, which we call the free\nvertex algebra corresponding to the given locality bound. In [J. of Algebra,\n217(2):496-527] some free vertex algebras were constructed and in certain\nspecial cases their linear bases were found. In this paper we generalize this\nconstruction and find linear bases of an arbitrary free vertex algebra.\n  It turns out that free vertex algebras are closely related to the vertex\nalgebras corresponding to integer lattices. The latter algebras play a very\nimportant role in different areas of mathematics and physics. Here we explore\nthe relation between free vertex algebras and lattice vertex algebras in much\ndetail. These results comply with the use of the word \"free\" in physical\nliterature refering to some elements of lattice vertex algebras, like in \"free\nfield\", \"free bozon\" or \"free fermion\".\n  Among other things, we find a nice presentation of lattice vertex algebras in\nterms of generators and relations, thus giving an alternative construction of\nthese algebras without using vertex operators. We remark that our construction\nworks in a very general setting; we do not assume the lattice to be positive\ndefinite, neither non-degenerate, nor of a finite rank.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2001 21:19:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2001 03:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

An\nunstable atom has amplitude in its original state after many lifetimes\n($\\tau_L$). But in the laboratory, transitions seem to go instantaneously, as\nsuggested by the term \"quantum jump.\"\n  The problem studied here is whether the \"jump\" can be assigned a duration, in\ntheory and in experiment. Two characteristic times are defined, jump time\n($\\tau_J$) and passage time ($\\tau_P$). Both use Zeno time, $\\tau_Z$, defined\nin terms of $H$ and its initial state as $\\tau_Z \\equiv \\hbar/\\sqrt{<\\psi|\n(H-E_\\psi)^2 |\\psi>}$, with $E_\\psi \\equiv <\\psi|H|\\psi>$.\n  $\\tau_J$ is defined in terms of the time needed to slow (\\`a la the quantum\nZeno effect) the decay: $\\tau_J \\equiv \\tau_Z^2/\\tau_L$. It appears in several\ncontexts. It is related to tunneling time in barrier penetration. Its inverse\nis the bandwidth of the Hamiltonian, in a time-energy uncertainty principle.\n$\\tau_J$ is also an indicator of the duration of the quadratic decay regime in\nboth experiment and in numerical calculations (cf. Fig.~2 of PRA 57,1509\n(1998).)\n  The passage time, $\\tau_P$, arises from unitary evolution sans\ninterpretation. It is based on a bound of Fleming (Nuov.

By including apparatus in $H$,\n$\\tau_P$ limits the observation of decay according to the quantum measurement\nideas proposed in \"Time's Arrows and Quantum Measurement,\" Cambridge U.
