In a bottom-up approach, a puzzle has been laid\non whether a quadruple lens can produce 17 images. The number of images is\ngoverned by the gravitational lens equation, and the equation for $n$-tuple\nlenses suggests that the maximum number of images of a point source potentially\nincreases as $n^2+1$. Indeed, the classes of $n=1, 2, 3$ lenses produce up to\n$n^2+1 = 2, 5, 10$ images.

This invariant theory\nallows one to compare gauges used in the work of other researchers and to find\nthe unambiguous criteria to separate the physical and coordinate effects. It is\nshown, in particular, that the so-called longitudial gauge, commonly used when\nconsidering inflation instability, leads to a fundamental overestimation of the\neffect because of non-physical perturbations of the proper time in the frame of\nreference specified by this gauge. Back reaction theories employing this sort\nof gauge [1] also involve coordinate effects. The invariant theory created here\nshows that the classical Lifshitz (1946) [2] gauge does not lead to\nnon-physical perturbations of the proper time and can be used to analyze the\ninflation regime and the back reaction of perturbations on this regime\nproperly. The first theory of back reaction on background of all types of\nperturbations (scalar, vector and tensor) based on this gauge was published in\n1975 [3] and has been applied recently to the inflation [4]. The investigation\nof long-length perturbations, which characterize the stability of the\ninflationary process, and quantum fluctuations, which form the\nHarrison-Zel'dovich spectrum at the end of inflation, is performed in the\ninvariant form. The invariant theory proposed allows one to examine the effect\nof quantum fluctuations on the inflationary stage when the periodic regime\nchanges to an aperiodic one. That only the invariant theory must be used to\nanalyze space experiments is one of the conclusions of the present work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2001 15:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The full equation additionally includes\nterms generated by a deviation from the paraxial approximation and by a\nlongitudinal electric-field component in the beam. Solitary-wave stationary\nsolutions to both the full and simplified equations are found, treating the\nterms which modify the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation as perturbations.\nWithin the framework of the perturbative approach, a conserved power of the\nbeam is obtained in an explicit form. It is found that the nonlinear\ndiffraction affects stationary beams much stronger than nonparaxiality and\nlongitudinal field. Stability of the beams is directly tested by simulating the\nsimplified equation, with initial configurations taken as predicted by the\nperturbation theory. The numerically generated solitary beams are always stable\nand never start to collapse, although they display periodic internal\nvibrations, whose amplitude decreases with the increase of the beam power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2001 10:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
