One is that, using the closed box model,\nempirical Schmidt law and star formation time, the distribution of metallicity\ncan be directly calculated. The other is that, when the simple gravitational\ninstability of a thin isothermal gas disc as first discussed by Toomre is\nconsidered, the star formation occurs only in the region where the surface\ndensity of gas satisfies the critical value, not everywhere of a gas disc.

This finding supports the mode\nidentifications that rely on the comparison between direct and\nPeriod-Luminosity (PL) based distance determinations but it is somewhat at\nvariance with the mode identification based on Fourier parameters. In fact, we\nfind from our models that fundamental and first overtone pulsators attain, for\nperiods ranging from 2.7 to 4 d, quite similar phi_21 values, making mode\ndiscrimination from this parameter difficult. The present mode identifications\nfor our sample of Cepheids are strengthened by the accuracy of their empirical\nradius estimates, as well as by the evidence that predicted fundamental and\nfirst overtone radii do not show, within the current uncertainty on the\nMass-Luminosity (ML) relation, any degeneracy in the same period range.\nAccurate radius determinations are therefore an excellent tool to unambiguously\ndetermine the pulsation modes of short-period Cepheids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2001 14:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We give some examples of restrictions they\nimpose on deterministic and probabilistic conversion between multipartite\nstates via local actions and classical communication. These include\nrestrictions which do not follow from any bipartite considerations. We derive\nsupermultiplicativity relations between each state's monotones and the\nmonotones for collective processing when the parties share several states. We\nalso investigate polynomial invariants under local unitary transformations, and\nshow that a large class of these are invariant under collective unitary\nprocessing and also multiplicative, putting restrictions, for example, on the\nexact conversion of multiple copies of one state to multiple copies of another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2001 18:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
