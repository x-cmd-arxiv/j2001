I review this progress. Stellar atmospheres can be probed whenever\nthe source in a microlensing event passes over the caustic (contour of infinite\nmagnification) induced by the lens because the caustic effectively resolves the\nsource. Broad-band observations of four events have yielded limb-darkening\nmeasurements, which in essence map the atmospheric temperature as a function of\ndepth. And now, for the first time, spectroscopic observations of one event\npromise much richer diagnostics of the source atmosphere. In the past two\nyears, a practical method has finally been developed to systematically measure\nthe lens masses in microlensing events. This will permit a census of all\nmassive objects, both dark and luminous, in the Galactic bulge, including\nlow-mass stars, brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. The\nmethod combines traditional ground-based photometry with astrometric and\nphotometric measurements by the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) in solar\norbit. Using a related technique SIM can also obtain accurate (>~ 1%) mass\nmeasurement of a dozen or so nearby stars, thus enabling precision tests of\nstellar models. Binary lenses can give rise to dramatic and easily detectable\nmicrolensing signatures, even for large mass ratios. This makes microlensing a\npotentially powerful probe of the companion mass distribution, especially in\nthe Galactic bulge where this function is difficult to probe by other\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2001 16:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

We show that\nboth the X-ray behaviour and the characteristics of the optical counterpart, BD\n+53 2790, are more consistent with a neutron star accreting from the wind of an\nearly-type star. The X-ray lightcurve shows irregular flaring and no\nindications of pulsations, while the very high hydrogen column density supports\naccretion from a dense wind. BD +53 2790 is shown not to be a classical Be\nstar, as believed until now, but rather a very peculiar late O-type active\nstar, exhibiting emission components in the HeII lines, complex spectral\nvariability and strong wind resonance lines in the ultraviolet. Though many of\nthe characteristics of the spectrum resemble those of the He-rich stars, the\nabsence of HeI variability makes a connection unlikely. The spectrum is\ncompatible with a composite of two stars of similar spectral type, though\ncircumstantial evidence points to a single very peculiar active early-type\nstar. This adds weight to the growing evidence that the traditional\nsubdivisions of supergiant and Be/X-ray binaries fail to cover the whole\nphenomenology of massive X-ray binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2001 19:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

On the\nother hand, the density profile corresponding to Bertschinger's solution (a\npower-law of slope $r^{2\\alpha-6}$) differs significantly from the density\nprofiles of CDM halos. We show that isotropic mass distributions with power-law\nphase-space density profiles form a one-parameter family of structures\ncontrolled by $\\kappa$, the ratio of the velocity dispersion to the peak\ncircular velocity.

In this paper, this picture is established for a large class of\nmodels of non-relativistic atoms and molecules coupled to the quantized\nradiation field, but with the simplifying feature that an (arbitrarily tiny,\nbut positive) infrared cutoff is imposed on the interaction Hamiltonian.\n  This result relies on a proof of asymptotic completeness for Rayleigh\nscattering of light on an atom. We establish asymptotic completeness of\nRayleigh scattering for a class of model Hamiltonians with the features that\nthe atomic Hamiltonian has point spectrum coexisting with absolutely continuous\nspectrum, and that either an infrared cutoff is imposed on the interaction\nHamiltonian or photons are treated as massive particles.\n  We show that, for models of massless photons, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian\nstrictly below the ionization threshold is purely continuous, except for the\ngroundstate energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2001 23:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The observed motional states perfectly match the calculated\ntemperatures. Significant heating is observed in the vicinity of the dark\nresonances of the Zeeman-split S_1/2-D_3/2 Raman transitions. Here two-photon\nprocesses dominate the interaction between lasers and ions. Parameter regimes\nof laser light are identified that imply most efficient laser cooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2001 13:28:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2002 13:36:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2002 14:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
