The observation of an IST very close to the quantum\nresistance for pairs, $R_{\\Box}^N \\sim h/4e^2$ on several substrates supports\nthis idea. The relevant length scales here are the localization length, and the\ncoherence length. However, at the transition, the localization length is much\nhigher than the superconducting coherence length, contrary to expectation for a\n\"homogeneous\" transition. This suggests the invalidity of a purely fermionic\nmodel for the transition.
