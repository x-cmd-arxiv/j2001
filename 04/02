Using the formalism which discriminates\nbetween major merger and accretion, the epoch of a cluster formation is\nidentified with that of the last major merger. Since tiny mass accretion after\nthe formation does not much affect the core structure of clusters, the\nproperties of X-ray emission from clusters are determined by the total mass and\ndensity at their formation time. Under these assumptions, we calculate X-ray\nluminosity and temperature functions of galaxy clusters.

In our model, luminosity function is shifted to a\nhigher luminosity and shows no significant evolution up to $z \\sim 1$,\nindependent of cosmological models. The clusters are populated on the\ntemperature-luminosity plane with a finite dispersion. Since the simple scaling\nmodel in which the gas temperature is equal to the virial temperature fails to\nreproduce the observed luminosity-temperature relation, we also consider a\nmodel which takes the effects of preheating into account.

Moreover this assumption, which precludes a polytrope from ever\naccreting 100% of the mass from an infalling shell, as a subsequent state will\neventually be a polytrope, is confirmed now by our finding that a collisionless\npolytrope cannot accrete 100% of an infalling shell while simultaneously\nguaranteeing that the entropy of the Universe as a whole increases.

The non-parametrical method utilizes only the\nknown $e/h$ ratios and the electron calibration constants and does not require\nthe determination of any parameters by a minimization technique. Thus, this\ntechnique lends itself to an easy use in a first level trigger. The\nreconstructed mean values of the hadron energies are within $\\pm 1%$ of the\ntrue values and the fractional energy resolution is $[(58\\pm3)%\n/\\sqrt{E}+(2.5\\pm0.3)%]\\oplus (1.7\\pm0.2)/E$. The value of the $e/h$ ratio\nobtained for the electromagnetic compartment of the combined calorimeter is\n$1.74\\pm0.04$ and agrees with the prediction that $e/h > 1.7$ for this\nelectromagnetic calorimeter. Results of a study of the longitudinal hadronic\nshower development are also presented. The data have been taken in the H8 beam\nline of the CERN SPS using pions of energies from 10 to 300 GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2001 09:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 May 2001 07:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

In particular, we study the effect of adding fluctuations to\nthe atom cavity transit time or to the atom-photon frequency detuning. By\nincluding such noise-producing mechanisms we study the probability and the\njoint probability for excited atoms to leave the cavity. The influence of such\nfluctuations on the phase structure of the micromaser as well as on the\nlong-time atom correlation length is also discussed. We also derive the\nasymptotic form of micromaser observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2001 14:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
