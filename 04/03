They are those with a red giant companion,\nT CrB, RS Oph, V745 Sco, and V3890 Sgr. Our model includes irradiations of the\ncompanion star and the accretion disk together with a shadowing effect on the\ncompanion by the accretion disk. The early visual light curves are well\nreproduced with a thermonuclear runaway model on a very massive white dwarf of\n1.37 Mo for T CrB, 1.37 Mo for RS Oph with low metallicity (Z=0.004), 1.35 Mo\nfor V745 Sco, and 1.35 Mo for V3890 Sgr. Each envelope mass at the optical\nmaximum is also estimated to be 3 x 10^{-6}, 2 x 10^{-6}, 5 x 10^{-6}, and 3 x\n10^{-6} Mo, indicating an average mass accretion rate of 0.4 x 10^{-7}, 1.2 x\n10^{-7}, 0.9 x 10^{-7}, and 1.1 x 10^{-7} Mo/yr during the quiescent phase.\nAlthough a large part of the envelope mass is blown in the wind, each WD can\nretain a substantial part of the envelope mass after hydrogen burning ends.\nThus, we have obtained net mass-increasing rates of the WDs as 0.1 x 10^{-7},\n0.12 x 10^{-7}, 0.05 x 10^{-7}, and 0.11 x 10^{-7} Mo/yr. These results\nstrongly indicate that the WDs in the recurrent novae have now grown up to near\nthe Chandrasekhar mass limit and will soon explode as a Type Ia supernova if\nthe WDs consist of carbon and oxygen. We also include a radiation-induced\nwarping instability of the accretion disk to reproduce the second peak of T CrB\noutbursts. Thus, we have clarified the reason why only T CrB shows a secondary\nmaximum but the other three systems do not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2001 10:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

In the SM the violation of CP in the weak\ninteractions has a single source: the phase of the quark mixing matrix (the CKM\nmatrix, for Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa). Most extensions of the SM exhibit new\nsources of CP violation. For instance, the truly minimal supersymmetric\nextension of the SM (CMSSM) has two new phases in addition to the CKM phase.\nGiven that CP violation is so tiny in the kaon system, is still largely\nunexplored in B physics and is negligibly small in the electric dipole moments,\nit is clear that new physics may have a good chance to manifest some departure\nfrom the SM in this particularly challenging class of rare phenomena.

In this sense, a controller\ncan be thought of as an actuation channel that acts on inputs to produce\ndesired outputs. In this transformation process, two different control\nstrategies can be adopted: (i) the controller applies an actuation dynamics\nthat is independent of the state of the system to be controlled (open-loop\ncontrol); or (ii) the controller enacts an actuation dynamics that is based on\nsome information about the state of the controlled system (closed-loop\ncontrol).

In the proposed term an\nadditional tensor has been introduced containing a charge density, analogous to\nthe energy-momentum tensor containing a mass density. (The contribution of the\nelectromagnetic fields has not been considered in this work.) The metric\ncomponents in the new equations may contain charge and mass contributions. In\nthe special relativistic case a set of four vacuum Maxwell equations is\nobtained from the new equations containing a special relativistic charge\ndensity. A related result was recently found by Jefimenko from a special\nrelativistic transformation. Moreover, from the postulated equations the usual\nspecial relativistic electric energy and Lorentz force can be calculated, when\nthe approximated electromagnetic metric is used. In the non-relativistic case\nthe usual Maxwell equations with rest charge density are obtained. In the\npresence of a static gravitational field a set of four Maxwell equations is\nobtained applying in the general relativistic case. From these equations the\ngenerally accepted isotropic velocity of light can be deduced. In addition,\ncalculated generalized Maxwell equations show that vacuum permittivity and\npermeability may differ from unity value in the presence of a big charge Q or a\nbig mass M.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2001 19:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

It is shown, in agreement with Bell's theorem, that the most general\nlocal hidden-variable model fails in reproducing the whole set of\nquantum-mechanical observables. We achieve this conclusion by employing two\ndifferent approaches. In the first approach, the local realistic observables\nare deduced from the most general premises concerning locality and realism, and\nBell-like inequalities are not employed. The other approach makes use of Bell's\ninequalities. Under particular conditions for the detection times, within the\nfirst approach the discrepancy between quantum mechanics and local realism for\nthe asymmetry parameter turns out to be not less than 20%. A similar\nincompatibility can be made evident by means of a Bell-type test, by employing\na Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt's inequality written in terms of properly\nnormalized observables. Because of its relatively low experimental accuracy,\nthe data obtained by the CPLEAR collaboration do not yet allow a decisive test\nof local realism. Such a test, both with and without the use of Bell's\ninequalities, should be feasible in the future at the Frascati Phi-factory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2001 18:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
