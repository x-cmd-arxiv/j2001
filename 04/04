We consider the resonance model for electron scattering by a\ntransition metal impurity and calculate the binding potential for spin\nexcitons. This potential is spin selective and is capable of binding a spin\nexciton with zero angular momentum. In order to trap an exciton with a nonzero\nangular momentum m, the potential must exceed a certain threshold value,\ndepending on m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2001 14:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The use of kronecker product in quantum information theory\nto get the exact spin Hamiltonian is given. The proof of non-commutativity of\nmatrices, when kronecker product is used between them is given. It is shown\nthat the non-commutative matrices after kronecker product are similar or they\nare similar matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2001 22:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
