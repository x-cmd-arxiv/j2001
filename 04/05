The data are analysed using a new\nevolutionary stellar population synthesis model to generate galaxy spectra at\nthe resolution given by their velocity dispersions. In particular we use a new\nage indicator that is virtually free of the effects of metallicity. We find\nthat the luminosity weighted mean ages of Virgo ellipticals are greater than ~8\nGyr, and show no clear trend with galaxy luminosity. We also find a positive\ncorrelation of metallicity with luminosity, colour and velocity dispersion. We\nconclude that the CMR is driven primarily by a luminosity-metallicity\ncorrelation. However, not all elements increase equally with the total\nmetallicity and we speculate that the CMR may be driven by both a total\nmetallicity increase and by a systematic departure from solar abundance ratios\nof some elements along the CMR. A full understanding of the role played by the\ntotal metallicity, abundance ratios and age in generating the CMR requires the\nanalysis of spectra of very high quality, such as those reported here, for a\nlarger number of galaxies in Virgo and other clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2001 17:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Thus,\nthat formalism may be thought of as the non-hermitean analog of the method due\nto Br\\'ezin, Itzykson, Parisi and Zuber for analyzing hermitean non-Gaussian\nrandom matrices. A somewhat surprising result is the so called \"Single Ring\"\ntheorem, namely, that the domain of the eigenvalue distribution in the complex\nplane is either a disk or an annulus. In this paper we extend previous results\nand provide simple new explicit expressions for the radii of the eigenvalue\ndistiobution and for the value of the eigenvalue density at the edges of the\neigenvalue distribution of the non-hermitean matrix in terms of moments of the\neigenvalue distribution of the associated hermitean matrix.

For example, the simple requirement that brane-bulk models\nshould be the result of having evolved from even more energetic string\nphenomena picks out a preferred time direction.\n  We question whether quantum cosmological reasoning can be applied in any\nmeaningful way to obtain, what are essentially, classical constructs . An\nalternative scheme is to more readily accept the PCP and allow the branes to\nalso become eternal. A perpetually expanding and contracting brane model could\nbe driven by the presence of charged black holes in the AdS bulk, that\neffectively violates the weak-energy condition as singularities are approached.\nThis can be contrasted with the so-called Ekpyrotic universe which also closely\naccepts the PCP. This being broken only by occasional collisions between\nbranes, that can then simulate a big bang cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2001 17:22:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2001 17:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

This coupling implies that a\nD0-brane may possess multipole moments with respect to the various type IIA\nsupergravity fields. Different such polarization states of the D0-brane will\nthus generate different long-range supergravity fields, and the corresponding\nsemi-classical supergravity solutions will have different geometries. In this\npaper, we reconsider such solutions from an eleven-dimensional perspective. We\nthus begin by deriving the ``superpartners'' of the eleven-dimensional\ngraviton. These superpartners are obtained by acting on the purely bosonic\nsolution with broken supersymmetries and, in theory, one can obtain the full\nBPS supermultiplet of states. When we dimensionally reduce a polarized\nsupergraviton along its direction of motion, we recover a metric which\ndescribes a polarized D0-brane. On the other hand, if we compactify along the\nretarded null direction we obtain the short distance, or ``near-horizon'',\ngeometry of a polarized D0-brane, which is related to finite $N$ Matrix theory.\nThe various dipole moments in this case can only be defined once the\neleven-dimensional metric is ``regularized'' and, even then, they are formally\ninfinite.

This manifold\nwhich is obtained carries an action of the Weyl group and a Toda lattice flow\nwhich is related to this action. This construction gives rise to a large family\nof compact manifolds which is parametrized by twisted sign actions of the Weyl\ngroup.

The algorithms shifting the range of the primary\nlocalization of a chosen bound state in a potential well of finite width are as\nwell applicable to the scattering functions if states of the continuous\nspectrum are considered as bound states normalized to unity but distributed on\nan infinite interval with vanishing density. The potential perturbations of the\nsame type on the half-axis concentrate the scattering wave at the origin, thus\ncreating a bound state embedded into the continuous spectrum (zero width\nresonance).

That is, we show that any operation on the combined system\nof Alice and Bob, which does not allow Bob to send messages to Alice, can be\nrepresented as an operation by Alice, transmitting a quantum particle to Bob,\nand a local operation by Bob.
