The crust is described by the\nBPS equation of state. A significant increase of the stellar radius is found\nclose to the Keplerian (mass-shedding limit) configuration. This leads to the\ndisappearance of the gap between the stellar surface and the innermost stable\ncircular orbit (ISCO) at very high rotation rates, for a rather broad range of\nstellar masses. The Keplerian configuration for the strange star with crust\ncorresponds to values of J, T/W which are about 20% smaller than in the case of\nbare strange stars.

At first we review that a\nDp-brane is equivalent to a configuration of infinitely many D($p-2$)-branes.\nIf we consider the worldvolume as that of the Dp-brane, coordinates of the\nDp-brane is commutative. On the other hand if we deal with the worldvolume as\nthat of the D($p-2$)-branes, since coordinates of many D-branes are promoted to\nmatrices the worldvolume theory is non-commutative one. Next we see that using\na point splitting reguralization gives a non-commutative D-brane, and a\nnon-commutative gauge field can be rewritten in terms of an ordinary gauge\nfield. The transformation is called the Seiberg-Witten map. And we introduce\nsecond class constraints as boundary conditions of an open string. Since\nNeumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions are mixed in the constraints when the\nopen string is coupled to a NS B field, the end points of the open string is\nnon-commutative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2001 06:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2001 02:46:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2001 05:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A difference in the expression level of a gene at two\ndifferent conditions/phenotypes, such as cancerous versus non-cancerous, one\nsubtype of cancer versus another, before versus after a drug treatment, is\nindicative of the relevance of that gene to the difference of the high-level\nphenotype. Each gene can be ranked by its ability to distinguish the two\nconditions. We study how the single-gene classification ability decreases with\nits rank (a Zipf's plot). Power-law function in the Zipf's plot is observed for\nthe four microarray datasets obtained from various cancer studies. This\npower-law behavior in the Zipf's plot is reminiscent of similar power-law\ncurves in other natural and social phenomena (Zipf's law). However, due to our\nchoice of the measure of importance in classification ability, i.e., the\nmaximized likelihood in a logistic regression, the exponent of the power-law\nfunction is a function of the sample size, instead of a fixed value close to 1\nfor a typical example of Zipf's law. The presence of this power-law behavior is\nimportant for deciding the number of genes to be used for a discriminant\nmicroarray data analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2001 00:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-09"}

Among thousands of genes whose\nexpression levels are measured, not all are needed for discriminant analysis: a\ngene may either not contribute to the separation of two types of\ntissues/cancers, or it may be redundant because it is highly correlated with\nother genes. There are two theoretical frameworks in which variable selection\n(or gene selection in our case) can be addressed. The first is model selection,\nand the second is model averaging. We have carried out model selection using\nAkaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion with logistic\nregression (discrimination, prediction, or classification) to determine the\nnumber of genes that provide the best model. These model selection criteria set\nupper limits of 22-25 and 12-13 genes for this data set with 38 samples, and\nthe best model consists of only one (no.4847, zyxin) or two genes. We have also\ncarried out model averaging over the best single-gene logistic predictors using\nthree different weights: maximized likelihood, prediction rate on training set,\nand equal weight. We have observed that the performance of most of these\nweighted predictors on the testing set is gradually reduced as more genes are\nincluded, but a clear cutoff that separates good and bad prediction performance\nis not found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2001 01:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
