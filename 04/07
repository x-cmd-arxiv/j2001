Both exchange\ninteraction and strong electron correlations, due to edge states, are taken\ninto account. They essentially modify the spatial behavior of the occupied\nlowest spin-up LL in comparison with that of the lowest spin-down LL, which is\ntotally empty. The contrast in the spatial behavior can be attributed to a\ndifferent effective one-electron lateral confining potentials for the\nspin-split LLs. Many-body effects on the spatially inhomogeneous spin-splitting\nare calculated within the screened Hartree-Fock approximation. It is shown\nthat, far from the edges, the maximum activation energy is dominated by the gap\nbetween the Fermi level and the bottom of the spin-down LL, because the gap\nbetween the Fermi level and the spin-up LL is much larger.

The synthesis method allows the\nresponse to be specified either of Butterworth or Chebyshev type. Both\nsymmetric (with equal input and output impedances) and non-symmetric (impedance\ntransforming) designs are feasible. Starting from a given number of sections,\ntype of response, and impedance transformation ratio and for a specified\nmidband coupling, power division ratio, isolation or directivity ripple\nbandwidth, the set of constants needed for the evaluation of the reflection\ncoefficient response is first calculated. The latter is used to define a\ndriving point impedance of the circuit, synthesize it and obtain the branch\nline immittances with the use of the concept of double length unit elements\n(DLUE). The experimental results obtained with microstrip hybrids constructed\nto test the validity of the brute force optimization and the synthesized\ndesigns show very close agreement with the computed responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2001 12:45:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 16:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}
