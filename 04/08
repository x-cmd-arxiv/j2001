The estimator has been widely used in astronomy, owing to its low level of\nnoise; it involves a weight function -- or smoothing kernel -- w(\\theta). We\nshow that this estimator is not unbiased, in the sense that the expectation\nvalue of the smoothed map is not the underlying process convolved with $w$, but\na convolution with a modified kernel w_eff(\\theta). We show how to calculate\nw_eff for a given kernel w and investigate its properties. In particular, it is\nfound that (1) w_eff is normalized, (2) has a shape `similar' to the original\nkernel w, (3) converges to w in the limit of high number density of data\npoints, and (4) reduces to a top-hat filter in the limit of very small number\ndensity of data points. Hence, although the estimator is biased, the bias is\nwell understood analytically, and since w_eff has all the desired properties of\na smoothing kernel, the estimator is in fact very useful. We present explicit\nexamples for several filter functions which are commonly used, and provide a\nseries expression valid in the limit of large density of data points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2001 17:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The cluster has an absolute visual magnitude M(V)=-13.2, comparable to\nthe brightest young `super-star clusters' in the Antennae merger galaxy. UBV\ncolors indicate an age of about 15 Myr. The cluster has a compact core (core\nradius = 1.3 pc), surrounded by an extended envelope. We estimate that the\neffective radius (Reff) = 13 pc, but this number is uncertain because the outer\nparts of the cluster profile gradually merge with the general field. Combined\nwith population synthesis models, the luminosity and age of the cluster imply a\nmass of 8.2x10^5 Msun for a Salpeter IMF extending down to 0.1 Msun, or\n5.5x10^5 Msun if the IMF is log-normal below 0.4 Msun. Depending on model\nassumptions, the central density of the cluster is between 5300 Msun pc^-3 and\n17000 Msun pc^-3, comparable to other high-density star forming regions. We\nalso estimate a dynamical mass for the cluster, using high-dispersion spectra\nfrom the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck I telescope. The velocity dispersion is\n10.0 +/- 2.7 km/s, implying a total cluster mass within 65 pc of (1.7 +/- 0.9)\nx 10^6 Msun. Comparing the dynamical mass with the mass estimates based on the\nphotometry and population synthesis models, the mass-to-light ratio is at least\nas high as for a Salpeter IMF extending down to 0.1 Msun, although a turn-over\nin the IMF at 0.4 Msun is still possible within the errors. The cluster will\npresumably remain bound, evolving into a globular cluster-like object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2001 22:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Cold sodium atoms are trapped in a far-detuned standing\nwave of light that is accelerated for a controlled duration. For a large\nacceleration the atoms can escape the trapping potential via tunneling.\nInitially the number of trapped atoms shows strong non-exponential decay\nfeatures, evolving into the characteristic exponential decay behavior. We\nrepeatedly measure the number of atoms remaining trapped during the initial\nperiod of non-exponential decay. Depending on the frequency of measurements we\nobserve a decay that is suppressed or enhanced as compared to the unperturbed\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2001 02:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
