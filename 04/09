They are also the\nmost relativistic objects known so far. GRBs occur when an ultrarelativisitic\nejecta is slowed down by internal shocks within the flow. Relativistic\nparticles accelerated within these shocks emit the observed gamma-rays by a\ncombination of synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. External shocks with\nthe circumstellar matter slow down further the ejecta and produce the\nafterglow, which lasts for months. Comparison of the predictions of this\nfireball model with observations confirm a relativistic macroscopic motion with\na Lorentz factor of $\\Gamma \\ge 100$. Breaks in the light curves of the\nafterglow indicate that GRBs are beamed with typical opening angles of a few\ndegrees. The temporal variability of the gamma-rays signal provide us with the\nbest indirect evidence on the nature of the ``internal engine'' that powers the\nGRBs and accelerates the relativistic ejecta, suggesting accretion of a massive\ndisk onto a newborn black hole: GRBs are the birth cries of these black holes.\nTwo of the most promising models: Neutron Star Mergers and Collapars lead\nnaturally to this scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Apr 2001 18:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Also, it is generally believed that neutron stars have magnetic fields\non the order of ten to the twelfth to ten to the thirteenth G. A previously\npredicted electromagnetic time dilation effect has been shown to correctly\npredict decay lifetimes of muons bound to atomic nuclei. In this paper it is\nshown that the electromagnetic time dilation effect, along with the\ngravitational time dilation effect, can produce total neutron star redshifts\nthat are substantially larger than 0.62. For instance, the redshift can cutoff\nradiation for B on the order of ten to the thirteenth G. Consequently, we can\nhave a neutron star that is unobservable except for localized surface regions\nwhere the cutoff condition does not hold. Assuming coherent radiation, a\nsurface region of this kind that does not include the star's rotation axis will\nemit a lighthouse type beam. Since the magnetic field in these regions will\nusually be strong enough to cause significant redshifts, and there is no reason\nto expect these regions to always be of constant size, shape, or field\nstrength, this model explains the predominance of radio waves, and the\nexistence of pulse variations, (e.g. nulling and drifting) in pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2001 14:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The translation of the available information between neighboring\nlocal regions is expressed by a Hamilton operator. A quantum mechanical\noperator can be associated to each local observable, such that expectation\nvalues of ``classical'' observables can be computed by the usual quantum\nmechanical rules. The requirement that correlation functions should respect\nequivalence relations for local obeservables induces a non-commutative product\nin classical statistics, in complete correspondence to the quantum mechanical\noperator product. We also discuss the issue of interference and the complex\nstructure of quantum mechanics within our classical statistical setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2001 10:03:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2001 11:10:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2002 14:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

According to this\ndefinition a {\\sl generalized quantum measurement} takes place when the value\nof a classical variable is influenced significantly by an earlier state of a\nquantum system. A generalized quantum measurement can then take place in\nequilibrium systems, provided the classical motion is chaotic. This paper deals\nwith this classical aspect of quantum measurement, assuming that the Heisenberg\ncut between the quantum dynamics and the classical dynamics is made at a very\nsmall scale. For simplicity, a gas with collisions is modelled by an `Arnold\ngas'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2001 15:23:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2002 14:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
