Mass ejection must be\nefficient, at least in some cases, in order to produce the observed population\nof moderately fast spinning millisecond pulsars. First we demonstrate, in the\nframework of the widely accepted recycling scenario, using a population\nsynthesis approach, that a significant number of pulsars with spin period below\none millisecond is expected.

We show how this mechanism could dramatically alter the\nbinary evolution since the mechanism that drives mass overflow from the inner\nLagrangian point is still active while the accretion is inhibited. Moreover we\ndemonstrate that the persistency of this ``radio ejection'' phase depends on\nthe binary orbital period, demonstrating that close systems (orbital periods\nlower than 1 hr) are the only possible hosts for ultra fast spinning neutron\nstars. This could explain why submillisecond pulsars have not been detected so\nfar, as current radio surveys are hampered by computational limitations with\nrespect to the detection of very short spin period pulsars in short orbital\nperiod binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2001 12:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A strong\nintramolecular hole-phonon coupling, connected with the Jahn-Teller effect of\nthe isolated positive ion, is expected to be important for both properties, but\nthe actual coupling strengths are so far unknown. Based on density functional\ncalculations, we determine the linear couplings of the two a_g, six g_g, and\neight h_g vibrational modes to the H_u HOMO level of the C60 molecule. The\ncouplings predict a D_5 distortion, and an H_u vibronic ground state for C60^+.\nThey are also used to generate the dimensionless coupling constant <lambda>\nwhich controls the superconductivity and the phonon contribution to the\nelectrical resistivity in the crystalline phase. We find that <lambda> is 1.4\ntimes larger in positively-charged C60 than in the negatively-doped case. These\nresults are discussed in the context of the available transport data and\nsuperconducting temperatures. The role of higher orbital degeneracy in\nsuperconductivity is also addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2001 13:57:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2001 08:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2001 19:22:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2001 15:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

However, the\ntension of the visible brane is positive in the usual HW phenomenology with\nstronger coupling on the hidden brane, both for standard and non-standard\nembedding. To make ekpyrotic scenario realistic one must solve the problem of\nthe negative cosmological constant on the visible brane and fine-tune the bulk\nbrane potential with an accuracy of $10^{-50}$. In terms of a canonically\nnormalized scalar field $\\phi$ describing the position of the brane, this\npotential must take a very unusual form $V(\\phi)\\sim e^{-{5000 \\phi\\over\nM_p}}$. We describe the problems which appear when one attempts to obtain this\npotential in string theory.

Unlike inflation, this\nmechanism exponentially amplifies not only quantum fluctuations, but also\ninitial inhomogeneities. As a result, to solve the homogeneity problem in this\nscenario, one would need the branes to be parallel to each other with an\naccuracy better than $10^{-60}$ on a scale $10^{30}$ times greater than the\ndistance between the branes. Thus, at present, inflation remains the only\nrobust mechanism that produces density perturbations with a flat spectrum and\nsimultaneously solves all major cosmological problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2001 20:17:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2001 22:57:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2001 19:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

Typical examples of such an action are linear actions, ie, when the\naction arises from a morphism of the group into GL(2,R), viewed as the group of\nlinear transformations of a copy of the affine plane in RP^{2}. We prove that\nin the general situation, such an action is always topologically linearisable,\nand that the linearisation is Lipschitz if and only if it is projective. This\nresult is obtained through the study of a certain family of flag structures on\nSeifert manifolds. As a corollary, we deduce some dynamical properties of the\ntransversely affine flows obtained by deformations of horocyclic flows. In\nparticular, these flows are not minimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2001 12:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}
