This is due to a geometrical effect,\nappearing when certain types of average densities are calculated along the past\nlight cone. The paper starts reviewing the argument concerning the possibility\nthat the galaxy distribution follows such a scaling pattern, and the premises\nbehind the assumption that the spatial homogeneity of standard cosmology can be\nobservable. Next, it is argued that to discuss observable homogeneity one needs\nto make a clear distinction between local and average relativistic densities,\nand showing how the different distance definitions strongly affect them,\nleading the various average densities to display asymptotically opposite\nbehaviours. Then the paper revisits Ribeiro's (1995: astro-ph/9910145) results,\nshowing that in a fully relativistic treatment some observational average\ndensities of the flat Friedmann model are not well defined at z ~ 0.1, implying\nthat at this range average densities behave in a fundamentally different manner\nas compared to the linearity of the Hubble law, well valid for z < 1. This\nconclusion brings into question the widespread assumption that relativistic\ncorrections can always be neglected at low z. It is also shown how some key\nfeatures of fractal cosmologies can be found in the Friedmann models. In view\nof those findings, it is suggested that the so-called contradiction between the\ncosmological principle, and the galaxy distribution forming an unlimited\nfractal structure, may not exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2001 20:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

A natural way to disentangle ``perturbative'' from\n  ``non-perturbative'' contributions below N_f^* is suggested. Assuming an\ninfrared fixed point is present in the perturbative part of the QCD coupling\neven in some range below N_f^* leads to the condition gamma(N_f^*)=1, where\ngamma is the critical exponent. This result is incompatible with the existence\nof an analogue of Seiberg free dual magnetic phase in QCD. Using the Banks-Zaks\nexpansion, one gets\n  4<N_f^*<6. The low value of N_f^* gives some justification to the infrared\nfinite coupling approach to power corrections, and suggests a way to compute\ntheir normalization from perturbative input. If the perturbative series are\nstill asymptotic in the negative coupling region, the presence of a negative\nultraviolet fixed point is required both in QCD and in supersymmetric QCD to\npreserve causality within the conformal window. Some evidence for such a fixed\npoint in QCD is provided through a modified Banks-Zaks expansion. Conformal\nwindow amplitudes, which contain power contributions, are shown to remain\ngenerically finite in the N_f=-\\infty one-loop limit in simple models with\ninfrared finite perturbative coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2001 16:16:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 May 2001 15:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
