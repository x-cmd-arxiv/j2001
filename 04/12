Since, however, many clusters without\nradio halos also possess substructure, the role of mergers in the formation of\nradio halos has remained unclear. By using power ratios to relate gravitational\npotential fluctuations to substructure in X-ray images, we provide the first\nquantitative comparison of the dynamical states of clusters possessing radio\nhalos. A correlation between the 1.4 GHz power (P_{1.4}) of the radio halo (or\nrelic) and the magnitude of the dipole power ratio (P_1/P_0) is discovered such\nthat approximately P_{1.4} ~ P_1/P_0; i.e., the strongest radio halos appear\nonly in those clusters currently experiencing the largest departures from a\nvirialized state. From additional consideration of a small number of highly\ndisturbed clusters without radio halos detected at 1.4 GHz, and recalling that\nradio halos are more common in clusters with high X-ray luminosity (Giovannini,\nTordi, & Feretti), we argue that radio halos form preferentially in massive\n(L_x >~ 0.5 x 10^{45} erg/s) clusters experiencing violent mergers (P_1/P_0 >~\n0.5 x 10^{-4}) that have seriously disrupted the cluster core.

Our\ninvestigation is based on an analytical model of the accretion luminosity at\nemergence as a function of progenitor mass, coupled to the inferred rate of\nobserved Type II supernovae in nearby galaxies. We find through a parameter\nsurvey that under optimistic assumptions the potential rate of observable\nevents can be as high as several per year. However, supernovae which produce\nblack holes are also likely to be low energy explosions and therefore\nsubluminous, as was the case for the best candidate to date, SN1997D. If black\nhole-forming supernovae are underdetected owing to lower luminosities, the rate\nof observing black hole emergence is probably not larger than once every few\nyears.

As the assumed flare height influences the derived flare energy,\nthe mathematical foundations of nanoflare distributions and their conversion to\ndifferent height assumptions are studied first. This also allows a comparison\nwith various published energy distributions differing in height assumptions and\nto relate the observations to the input parameters of the heating model. An\nanalytic evaluation of the power spectrum yields the relationship between the\naverage time profile of nanoflares (or microflares), assumed to be self-similar\nin energy, and the power spectrum.

The effect of natural variations in the\ncosmic ray flux is large, causing estimated changes in the Earth's energy\nradiation balance that are comparable to those attributed to greenhouse gases\nfrom the burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. However a\ndirect link between cosmic rays and cloud formation has not been unambiguously\nestablished. We therefore propose to experimentally measure cloud (water\ndroplet) formation under controlled conditions in a test beam at CERN with a\nCLOUD chamber, duplicating the conditions prevailing in the troposphere. These\ndata, which have never been previously obtained, will allow a detailed\nunderstanding of the possible effects of cosmic rays on clouds and confirm, or\notherwise, a direct link between cosmic rays, global cloud cover and the\nEarth's climate. The measurements will, in turn, allow more reliable\ncalculations to be made of the residual effect on global temperatures of the\nburning of fossil fuels, an issue of profound importance to society.\nFurthermore, light radio-isotope records indicate a correlation has existed\nbetween global climate and the cosmic ray flux extending back over the present\ninter-glacial and perhaps earlier. This suggests it may eventually become\npossible to make long-term (10-1,000 year) predictions of changes in the\nEarth's climate, provided a deeper understanding can be achieved of the\n``geomagnetic climate'' of the Sun and Earth that modulates the cosmic-ray\nflux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2001 11:37:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2001 12:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

S_D is the dynamic\nsystem described by the Dirac equation. Its classical analog S_dc is described\nby a system of ordinary differential equations, containing the quantum constant\nh as a parameter. Dynamic equations for S_dc are determined by the Dirac\nequation uniquely. Both dynamic systems S_D and S_dc appear to be\nnonrelativistic. One succeeded in transforming nonrelativistic dynamic system\nS_dc into relativistic one S_dcr. The dynamic system S_dcr appears to be a\ntwo-particle structure (special case of a relativistic rotator). It explains\nfreely such properties of S_D as spin and magnetic moment, which are strange\nfor pointlike structure. The rigidity function f_r(a), describing rotational\npart of total mass as a function of the radius $a$ of rotator, has been\ncalculated for S_dcr. For investigation of S_D and construction of S_dc one\nuses new dynamic methods: dynamic quantization and dynamic disquantization.\nThese relativistic pure dynamic procedures do not use principles of quantum\nmechanics (QM).
