We find that the initial chemical\nstructure of the WD is changed but the material is not fully homogenized. The\nexploding WD sustains a central region with a low C/O ratio. This implies that\nthe explosive nuclear burning will begin in a partially C-depleted environment.\nThe thermonuclear runaway happens in a well defined region close to the center.\nIt is induced by compressional heat when matter is brought inwards by\nconvective flows.
