The infinitesimal\nstructure of this stack is described in a relatively straightforward manner,\nsimilar to that of usual stable curves.\n  We construct representable morphisms from the stacks of stable twisted r-spin\ncurves to the stacks of stable r-spin curves, and show that they are\nisomorphisms. Many delicate features of r-spin curves, including torsion free\nsheaves with power maps, arise as simple by-products of twisted spin curves.\nVarious constructions, such as the d bar-operator of Seeley and Singer and\nWitten's cohomology class go through without complications in the setting of\ntwisted spin curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2001 21:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The peak currents and luminosity steadily increased\nthrough the end of the 2000 run on October 31. By that time, 0.75 A of\nelectrons (the design current) routinely collided with 1.4 A of positrons in\n657 bunches, to give a peak luminosity of 2.6E33 cm^{-2} s^{-1}. We delivered\nan integrated luminosity of up to 184/pb per day and 1033 per week; BABAR\nlogged a total of 25/fb. Three days of machine development at the end of the\nrun raised the peak luminosity to 3.29E33, exceeding the design goal of 3.0.\nBABAR then logged data for an hour, starting with a peak of 3.20. Next, we\nachieved the design value for positron current, 2.14 A, operating without\ncollisions. The major limitation has been growth in the size of the positron\nbeam in the low-energy ring (LER) due to electron clouds and multipacting.\nSince the arcs benefit from antechambers and a TiN coating with low secondary\nemission, our efforts have concentrated on the straights, where we added\nsolenoid windings. Each straight wound allowed higher LER current without\nblow-up, and a consequent increase in luminosity. Measurements of the\nbunch-by-bunch luminosity showed that the effect becomes significant by about\nthe tenth bunch in a train, but clears after a short gap. Careful control of\nthe fill pattern has thus been essential in raising luminosity. For the 2001\nrun, which began in February, we added a third LER RF station, to collide with\nmore LER current and more bunches, and also tried reducing beta_x* from 50 to\n35 cm, with the goal of reaching a luminosity of 5E33 by year's end. In 2003,\nwe plan to add a fourth LER and sixth HER RF station to reach 1E34.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2001 23:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is proposed to\nuse the SLAC linac and damping rings in their present mode of operation for PEP\nII injection, where 30 GeV beams are also delivered at 10 Hz to the FFTB. High\npeak currents are obtained with the addition of a second bunch compressor in\nthe linac. In order to minimize the synchrotron radiation induced emittance\ngrowth in the bunch compressor it is necessary to locate the new bunch\ncompressor at the low-energy end of the linac, just after the damping rings.\nThe bunch compressor is a duplicate of the LCLS chicane-style bunch compressor.\nThis test beam would provide an exciting possibility to test LCLS undulator\nsections and provide a unique high-brightness source of incoherent X-rays and\nbegin developing the LCLS experimental station.
