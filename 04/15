It is shown that: (a) such indefiniteness can be represented by\nGrassmanian numbers, (b) a displacement of the wormhole mouth is connected with\na change of the Grassmanian numbers (coordinates). In such an interpretation of\nsupersymmetry the corresponding supersymmetrical fields must be described in an\ninvariant manner on the background of the spacetime foam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2001 04:28:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2001 03:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

After a brief review of standard\nmaterial, mostly without proofs, the Morse theory of complex Grassmannian\nmanifolds is worked out in detail. In contrast to standard treatments, gradient\nflow lines and their structure are emphasized. This leads to a convenient\ninterpretation of Schubert calculus via the momentum map of a torus action,\nand, more generally, to a still-unfolding toric/combinatoric manifestation of\nMorse theory. The latter provides a miniature version of the \"field-theoretic\npoint of view\" of Cohen-Jones-Segal, Betz-Cohen, and Fukaya.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2001 06:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
