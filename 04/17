The instability has been initialized by\nrandom velocity perturbations. In the linear stage, the evolution is not much\ndifferent from that without rotation and the mixed (undular + interchange) mode\nregulates the system. The interchange mode induces alternating dense and\nrarefied regions with small radial wavelengths, while the undular mode bends\nthe magnetic field lines in the plane of azimuthal and vertical directions. In\nthe nonlinear stage, flow motion overall becomes chaotic as in the case without\nrotation. However, as the gas in higher positions slides down along field lines\nforming supersonic flows, the Coriolis force becomes important. As oppositely\ndirected flows fall into valleys along both sides of magnetic field lines, they\nexperience the Coriolis force toward opposite directions, which twists magnetic\nfield lines there. Hence, we suggest that the Coriolis force plays a role in\nrandomizing magnetic field. The three-dimensional density structure formed by\nthe instability is still sheet-like with the short dimension along the radial\ndirection, as in the case without rotation. However, the long dimension is now\nslightly tilted with respect to the mean field direction. The shape of high\ndensity regions is a bit rounder. The maximum enhancement factor of the\nvertical column density relative to its initial value is about 1.5, which is\nsmaller than that in the case without rotation. We conclude that uniform\nrotation doesn't change our point of view that the Parker instability alone is\nnot a viable mechanism for the formation of giant molecular clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2001 16:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The timescale for angular momentum loss above\nthe fully convective boundary is ~ 2 orders of magnitude longer than inferred\nfrom the older model, and the observed angular momentum loss properties show no\nevidence for a change in a behavior at the fully convective boundary. This\nprovides evidence against the hypothesis that the period gap is caused by an\nabrupt change in the angular momentum loss law when the secondary becomes fully\nconvective. It also implies that the timescale for CV evolution is much longer\nthan it was than previously thought, comparable to a Hubble time.

The energetics of different spin configurations are\nestimated using the fixed-spin-moment (FSM) method. From the total energy vs\nspin magnetic moment curve for LaCoO$_3$ the ground state is found to be\nnonmagnetic with the Co ions in a low-spin (LS) state, a result that is\nconsistent with the experimental observations. Somewhat higher in energy, we\nfind an intermediate-spin (IS) state with spin moment $\\sim$1.2 $\\mu_{B}$/f.u.\n  From the anomalous temperature dependent susceptibility along with the\nobservation of an IS state we predict metamagnetism in LaCoO$_3$ originating\nfrom an LS-to-IS transition. The IS state is found to be metallic and the\nhigh-spin (HS) state of LaCoO$_3$ is predicted to be a half-metallic\nferromagnet.

If\nthis correlation were to be established by a causal mechanism, it could provide\na crucial step in understanding the long-sought mechanism connecting solar and\nclimate variability. The Earth's climate seems to be remarkably sensitive to\nsolar activity, but variations of the Sun's electromagnetic radiation appear to\nbe too small to account for the observed climate variability. However, since\nthe GCR intensity is strongly modulated by the solar wind, a GCR-cloud link may\nprovide a sufficient amplifying mechanism. Moreover if this connection were to\nbe confirmed, it could have profound consequences for our understanding of the\nsolar contributions to the current global warming. The CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving\nOUtdoor Droplets) project proposes to test experimentally the existence a link\nbetween cosmic rays and cloud formation, and to understand the microphysical\nmechanism. CLOUD plans to perform detailed laboratory measurements in a\nparticle beam at CERN, where all the parameters can be precisely controlled and\nmeasured. The beam will pass through an expansion cloud chamber and a reactor\nchamber where the atmosphere is to be duplicated by moist air charged with\nselected aerosols and trace condensable vapours. An array of external detectors\nand mass spectrometers is used to analyse the physical and chemical\ncharacteristics of the aerosols and trace gases during beam exposure. Where\nbeam effects are found, the experiment will seek to evaluate their significance\nin the atmosphere by incorporating them into aerosol and cloud models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2001 19:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}
