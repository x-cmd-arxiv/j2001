The\nspectra reveal the presence of three kinematic components of absorption in\nLy-alpha, C IV, and N V, at radial velocities of -1365, -548, and -724 km/s\nwith respect to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy (Components 1, 2 and\n3, respectively); Component 1 also shows absorption by Si IV. Component 3 was\nnot detected in any of the earlier Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS)\nspectra, and the C IV absorption in the other components has changed since the\nmost recent GHRS observation obtained 5 yr earlier. Somewhat unexpectedly, each\ncomponent has a covering factor (of the continuum source + broad emission line\nregion) of about 0.6. We have calculated photoionization models to match the UV\ncolumn densities in each of the three components. Based on the model results,\nthere should be strong absorption in the bandpass of the Far Ultraviolet\nSpectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), 912 - 1200 A, including saturated O VI lines at\neach component velocity. The models also predict large O VII and O VIII column\ndensities but suggest that the UV absorbers cannot account for all of the X-ray\nabsorption detected in recent Chandra spectra. Finally, there is no evidence\nfor a correlation between the characteristics of the UV absorbers and the UV\ncontinuum flux, which suggests that the variations observed in the GHRS and\nSTIS spectra are due in large part to changes in the column densities of the\nabsorbers as the result of transverse motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2001 14:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

This component\nprovides up to 50% of the detected sources in the plane between the bulge and\nl=27 deg. or l=-14 deg. This component is shown to be consistent with an\nin-plane bar with a position angle of 40 deg. and half-length of 3.9 kpc.\nHowever, there is also a major peak in the counts at l=-22 deg., which\ncoincides with the tangential point of the so-called 3 kpc arm.

The coherent and incoherent intermediate\nscattering functions, F_d(q,t) and F_s(q,t), show a crossover from a nearly\nexponential decay at high temperatures to a two-step relaxation at low\ntemperatures. Close to the critical temperature of mode-coupling theory (MCT)\nthe correlators obey in the alpha-regime the time temperature superposition\nprinciple (TTSP) and show a weak stretching. We determine the wave-vector\ndependence of the stretching parameter and find that for F_d(q,t) it shows\noscillations which are in phase with the static structure factor. The\ntemperature dependence of the alpha- relaxation times tau shows a crossover\nfrom an Arrhenius law at low temperatures to a weaker T-dependence at\nintermediate and high temperatures. At the latter temperatures the T-dependence\nis described well by a power law. We find that the exponent gamma of the power\nlaw for tau are significantly larger than the one for the diffusion constant.\nThe q-dependence of the alpha-relaxation times for F_d(q,t) oscillates around\ntau(q) for F_s(q,t) and is in phase with the structure factor. Due to the\nstrong vibrational component of the dynamics at short times the TTSP is not\nvalid in the beta- relaxation regime. We show, however, that in this time\nwindow the shape of the curves is independent of the correlator and is given by\na functional form proposed by MCT. We find that the value of the von Schweidler\nexponent and the value of gamma for finite q are compatible with the expression\nproposed by MCT. We conclude that, in the temperature regime where the\nrelaxation times are mesoscopic, many aspects of the dynamics of this strong\nglass former can be rationalized very well by MCT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2001 06:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In these conditions a new form of\nrefined similarity law has been found able to describe the increased level of\nintermittency which characterizes shear dominated flows.

Through simulation of physical models of quantum computer\nhardware, we analyze the difficulties that are encountered in programming\nphysical realizations of quantum computers. Examples of logically identical\nimplementations of the controlled-NOT operation and Grover's database search\nalgorithm are used to demonstrate that the results of a quantum computation are\nunstable with respect to the physical realization of the quantum computer. We\ndiscuss the origin of these instabilities and discuss possibilities to overcome\nthis, for practical purposes, fundamental limitation of quantum computers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2001 14:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This model is known as a possible candidate for experimental\nrealization of quantum computation. We present the theory for finding\ndelocalization transition and show that for the interaction between nearest\nqubits, the transition is very different from that to quantum chaos. We explain\nthis phenomena by showing that in the considered region of parameters our model\nis close to an integrable one. According to a general opinion, the threshold\nfor the onset of quantum chaos due to the interqubit interaction decreases with\nan increase of the number of qubits. Contrary to this expectation, for a\nmagnetic field with constant gradient we have found that chaos border does not\ndepend on the number of qubits. We give analytical estimates which explain this\neffect, together with numerical data supporting our analysis. Random models\nwith long-range interactions are studied as well. In particular, we show that\nin this case the delocalization and quantum chaos borders coincide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2001 14:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
