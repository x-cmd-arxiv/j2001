Iron emission is often a severe contaminant in\noptical--UV spectra of AGNs. Its presence complicates and limits the accuracy\nof measurements of both strong and weak emission lines and the continuum\nemission, affecting studies of line and continuum interrelations, the\nionization structure, and elemental abundances in AGNs. Despite the wealth of\nwork on modeling the AGN FeII emission and the need to account for it in\nobserved AGN spectra, there is no UV template electronically available to aid\nthis process. The iron template we present is based on HST spectra of the\nNarrow Line Seyfert 1, IZw1. Its intrinsic narrow lines (~900 km/s) and rich\niron spectrum make the template particularly suitable for use with most AGN\nspectra. The iron emission spectrum and the line identifications and\nmeasurements are presented and compared with the work of Laor et al.

For 148 of these galaxies the\nredshifts are such that the HI emission (if any) would lie within our data\ncube. We use the known redshifts of these galaxies to coadd their spectra and\nthus improve our sensitivity to HI emission. The technique is fairly successful\n-- the coadded spectra allow detection of an average mass content of ~ 9x10^8\nMsun, almost an order of magnitude lower than for direct detection of\nindividual objects.\n  By dividing the total galaxy sample into subsamples we find that the gas\ncontent of late type galaxies that lie outside the X-ray emitting core of the\ncluster is substantially higher than that of those within the core.

We then show that it is a good approximation to assume that each peak in\neither SZ effect is associated with one and only one dark matter halo. This\nallows us to use our knowledge of the properties of haloes to estimate the peak\nheight distributions.

The optical depth is an increasing function of halo\nmass, and the distribution of halo speeds is Gaussian, with a dispersion which\nis approximately independent of halo mass. This means that observations of the\nkinematic effect can be used to put constraints on how the abundance of massive\nclusters evolves, and on the evolution of cluster velocities.

The basic idea is to\nregard a plane curve D in P^2 as a pair (P^2,D) of a surface together with a\ndivisor, and allow both the surface and the curve to degenerate. For plane\ncurves of degree d at least 4, we obtain a compactification M_d which is a\nmoduli space of stable pairs (X,D) using the log minimal model program. A\nstable pair (X,D) consists of a surface X such that -K_X is ample and a divisor\nD in a given linear system on X with specified singularities. Note that X may\nbe non-normal, and K_X is Q-Cartier but not Cartier in general. We give a rough\nclassification of stable pairs of arbitrary degree, a complete classification\nin degrees 4 and 5, and a partial classification in degree 6. The\ncompactification is particularly simple if d is not a multiple of 3 - in\nparticular the surface X has at most 2 components. We give a characterisation\nof these surfaces in terms of the singularities and the Picard numbers of the\ncomponents.

To this\nend, a recently developed phenomenological-operator approach that allows for\nthe influence of noise will be applied. This approach furnishes a\nstraightforward technique to estimate the fidelity of the prepared state in the\npresence of errors, precluding the usual extensive ab initio calculations.

We prove a lower bound for the static predecessor\nproblem in the address-only version of this model where we allow quantum\nparallelism only over the `address lines' of the queries. The address-only\nquantum cell probe model subsumes the classical cell probe model, and many\nquantum query algorithms like Grover's algorithm fall into this framework. Our\nlower bound improves the previous known lower bound for the predecessor problem\nin the classical cell probe model with randomised query schemes, and matches\nthe classical deterministic upper bound of Beame and Fich. Beame and Fich have\nalso proved a matching lower bound for the predecessor problem, but only in the\nclassical deterministic setting. Our lower bound has the advantage that it\nholds for the more general quantum model, and also, its proof is substantially\nsimpler than that of Beame and Fich. We prove our lower bound by obtaining a\nround elimination lemma for quantum communication complexity. A similar lemma\nwas proved by Miltersen, Nisan, Safra and Wigderson for classical communication\ncomplexity, but it was not strong enough to prove a lower bound matching the\nupper bound of Beame and Fich. Our quantum round elimination lemma also allows\nus to prove rounds versus communication tradeoffs for some quantum\ncommunication complexity problems like the \"greater-than\" problem. We also\nstudy the \"static membership\" problem in the quantum cell probe model.\nGeneralising a result of Yao, we show that if the storage scheme is implicit,\nthat is it can only store members of the subset and `pointers', then any\nquantum query scheme must make $\\Omega(\\log n)$ probes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2001 22:33:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2001 14:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
