Due to the existence of a minimum phase velocity $V_c$ for\nsurface waves, the problem is similar to the generation of rotons in superfluid\nhelium near their minimum. In both cases waves or rotons are produced at\n$V>V_c$ due to {\\em Cherenkov radiation}. We find that the transition to the\nwave drag state is continuous: in the vicinity of the bifurcation the wave\nresistance force is proportional to $\\sqrt{V-V_c}$ for various fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2001 11:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Theoretical explanations of this extreme energy focusing\nare controversial and difficult to validate experimentally. We propose to use\nmolecular dynamics simulations of the collapsing gas bubble to clarify the\nenergy focusing mechanism, and provide insight into the mechanism of light\nemission.\n  In this paper, we model the interior of a collapsing noble gas bubble as a\nhard sphere gas driven by a spherical piston boundary moving according to the\nRayleigh-Plesset equation. We also include a simple treatment of ionization\neffects in the gas at high temperatures. By using fast, tree-based algorithms,\nwe can exactly follow the dynamics of million particle systems during the\ncollapse. Our results clearly show strong energy focusing within the bubble,\nincluding the formation of shocks, strong ionization, and temperatures in the\nrange of 50,000---500,000 degrees Kelvin. Our calculations show that the\ngas-liquid boundary interaction has a strong effect on the internal gas\ndynamics. We also estimate the duration of the light pulse from our model,\nwhich predicts that it scales linearly with the ambient bubble radius.\n  As the number of particles in a physical sonoluminescing bubble is within the\nforeseeable capability of molecular dynamics simulations we also propose that\nfine scale sonoluminescence experiments can be viewed as excellent test\nproblems for advancing the art of molecular dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2001 18:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}
