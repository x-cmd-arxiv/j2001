They were found to be in a good quantitative agreement with the\ntheory. (ii) It was shown that the mechanism of SS amplitude saturation is due\nto the nonlinear attenuation of SS via three wave interactions between the SS\nwaves. Strong low frequency amplitude fluctuations of SS above the threshold\nwere observed. The spectra of these fluctuations had a universal shape with\nexponentially decaying tails. Furthermore, the spectral width grew continuously\nwith the FS amplitude. The role of three and four wave interactions are\ndiscussed with respect to the nonlinear SS behavior. The first evidence of\nGaussian statistics of the wave amplitudes for the parametrically generated\nwave ensemble was obtained. (iii) The experiments on simultaneous pumping of\nthe FS and independent SS waves revealed new effects. Below the instability\nthreshold, the SS phase conjugation as a result of three-wave interactions\nbetween the FS and SS waves was observed. Above the threshold two new effects\nwere found: a giant amplification of the SS wave intensity and strong resonance\noscillations of the SS wave amplitude as a function of the FS amplitude.\nQualitative explanations of these effects are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2001 16:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
