We often detected one strong\nand one weak compact radio component, moving in opposite directions from the\nradio core. We suggest that the moving components are radio lobes generated by\nthe disruption of energy flow in a twin-beam from the binary system. The\naverage lifetime of a lobe-pair, the space motion of the lobes and the measured\nenergy flow in the beam are discussed in arXiv:astro-ph/0104325. The lobe has a\nflux density that is variable over a time-scale of one hour, a measured minimum\nsize of 1 mas (2.8 au), and is extended perpendicular to its motion. This short\nelectron radiative lifetime may be caused by synchrotron losses if the lobe\nmagnetic field is 300 G, or by adiabatic expansion of the electrons as soon as\nthey are produced at the working surface. The lobes also show periods of slow\nexpansion and a steepening radio spectrum, perhaps related to the\ncharacteristics of the beam energy flow. The radio morphology for Sco X-1 is\nmore simple than for most other Galactic jet sources. The lobes of Sco X-1 are\nsimilar to hot-spots found in many extragalactic double sources. Scaling the\nphenomena observed in Sco X-1 to extragalactic sources implies hot-spot\nvariability time-scales of 10^4 yr and hot-spot lifetimes of 10^5 yr. The\nrecurrent formation of lobes in Sco X-1 probably does not occur for\nextragalactic radio sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2001 16:00:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 May 2001 22:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

For\ndifferent models of the electron-phonon spectral function $\\alpha^2F(\\Omega)$\nwe solve numerically the Eliashberg equations to find which values of the\nelectron-phonon coupling $\\lambda$, of the logarithmic phonon frequency\n$\\Omega_{ln}$ and of the Coulomb pseudopotential $\\mu^*$ reproduce the\nexperimental data of Rb$_3$C$_{60}$. We find that the solutions are essentially\nindependent of the particular shape of $\\alpha^2F(\\Omega)$ and that, to explain\nthe experimental data of Rb$_3$C$_{60}$, one has to resort to extremely large\ncouplings: $\\lambda=3.0\\pm 0.8$. This results differs from the usual partial\nanalyses reported up to now and we claim that this value exceeds the maximum\nallowed $\\lambda$ compatible with the crystal lattice stability. Moreover, we\nshow quantitatively that the obtained values of $\\lambda$ and $\\Omega_{ln}$\nstrongly violate Migdal's theorem and consequently are incompatible with the\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory. One has therefore to consider the generalization of\nthe theory of superconductivity in the nonadiabatic regime to account for the\nexperimental properties of fullerides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2001 11:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

For boundary-type methods, we\nderive the indirect and direct symmetric boundary knot methods (BKM). The\nresulting interpolation matrix of both is always symmetric irrespective of\nboundary geometry and conditions. In particular, the direct BKM applies the\npractical physical variables rather than expansion coefficients and becomes\nvery competitive to the boundary element method. On the other hand, based on\nthe multiple reciprocity principle, we invent the RBF-based boundary particle\nmethod (BPM) for general inhomogeneous problems without a need using inner\nnodes. The direct and symmetric BPM schemes are also developed.\n  For domain-type RBF discretization schemes, by using the Green integral we\ndevelop a new Hermite RBF scheme called as the modified Kansa method (MKM),\nwhich differs from the symmetric Hermite RBF scheme in that the MKM discretizes\nboth governing equation and boundary conditions on the same boundary nodes. The\nlocal spline version of the MKM is named as the finite knot method (FKM). Both\nMKM and FKM significantly reduce calculation errors at nodes adjacent to\nboundary. In addition, the nonsingular high-order fundamental or general\nsolution is strongly recommended as the RBF in the domain-type methods and dual\nreciprocity method approximation of particular solution relating to the BKM.\n  It is stressed that all the above discretization methods of boundary-type and\ndomain-type are symmetric, meshless, and integration-free. The spline-based\nschemes will produce desirable symmetric sparse banded interpolation matrix.
