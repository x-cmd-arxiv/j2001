We consider a\nmulti-density model for radio recombination lines and show why previous models,\nwhich were based on the assumption of gas at a single density, are valid in\nmany situations. The models show that the ionized gas has a density of ~10^4\n/cc in both galaxies, with an effective size of 2-10 pc and a total mass of\nabout 10^4 Msun. The derived production rate of Lyman continuum photons is ~2.5\nx 10^{52} /s in both the galaxies and the corresponding mass of stars (assuming\na Salpeter IMF) is ~10^5 msun. The implied stellar density shows that the\nobserved radio recombination lines arise from ionized gas around super star\nclusters (SSCs) in both galaxies (these SSCs have been recently detected\nthrough their radio continuum emission). The existence of ~10^4 Msun of ionized\ngas within a few parsecs of an SSC places strict constraints on dynamical\nmodels. Using simple arguments, the parameter space for a few possible models\nare derived. The well known radio-FIR correlation also holds for NGC 5253,\nalthough the radio emission from this galaxy is almost completely thermal.

At high enough energies, whichever hadronic configuration the\nphoton fluctuates into, the interaction at a given impact parameter with the\nheavy nuclear target will eventually reach its geometrical limit corresponding\nto the scattering from a black disk. An attractive feature of the BBL regime\nfor a large nucleus is that the interaction is strong although the coupling\nconstant is small. Predictions for longitudinal and transverse distributions of\nthe leading hadrons in inclusive and diffractive channels and exclusive vector\nmeson production are found to be strikingly different in BBL and the leading\ntwist approximation. In particular, the multiplicity of leading hadrons in the\ncurrent fragmentation region is strongly suppressed, while the cross section of\ndiffractive vector meson production by longitudinally polarized photons is $\n\\propto 1/Q^2$. The x and $Q^2$ ranges where BBL maybe reached are calculated\nfor the interaction of color triplet and color octet dipoles at central impact\nparameters.

One cannot think any more of charmonium produced on a bound\nnucleon which then attenuates as it passes through the rest of the nucleus. The\ncoherence length of charmonium production substantially exceeds the nuclear\nradius in the new energy range. Therefore the production amplitudes on\ndifferent nucleons, rather than the cross sections, add up and interfere, i.e.\nshadowing is at work. So far no theoretical tool has been available to\ncalculate nuclear effects for charmonium production in this energy regime. We\ndevelop a light-cone Green function formalism which incorporates the effects of\nthe coherence of the production amplitudes and of charmonium wave function\nformation, and is the central result of this paper. We found a substantial\ndeviation from QCD factorization, namely, gluon shadowing is much stronger for\ncharmonium production than it is in DIS.

Covariant numerical solutions of the ultrarelativistic\nBoltzmann equation are obtained using the MPC parton cascade technique. For\ntypical pQCD (~3 mb) elastic cross sections, extreme initial gluon densities,\ndN/deta ~ 15000, are required to reproduce the elliptic flow saturation pattern\nreported by STAR. However, we show that the solutions depend mainly on the\ntransport opacity, $\\chi=\\int dz \\sigma_t\\rho_g$, and thus the data can also be\nreproduced with dN/deta ~ 1000, but with extreme elastic parton cross sections,\n\\~45 mb. We demonstrate that the spectra and elliptic flow are dominated by\nnumerical artifacts unless parton subdivisions ~100-1000 are applied to retain\nLorentz covariance for RHIC initial conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2001 20:53:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 May 2001 01:13:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2003 01:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

The molecules are modeled by\nhipercyclic replicators A which are capable of replicating via binary fission A\n+ E --2A with production rates s as well as via catalytically assisted\nreplication 2A + E --3A with rate c. In addition, a molecule can degrade into\nits source materials E with rate $\\gamma$. In the asymptotic regime the\npopulation can be characterized by the presence (active phase) and the absence\n(empty phase) of replicators in the lattice. In both diffusion regimes, we find\nthat for small values of the ratio c/$\\gamma$ these phases are separated by a\nsecond-order phase transition which is in the universality class of the\ndirected percolation, while for small values s/$gamma$ the phase transition is\nof first order. Furthermore, we illustrate the suitability of the dynamic Monte\nCarlo method, which is based on the analysis of the spreading behaviour of a\nfew active cells in the center of an otherwise infinite empty lattice, to\nadress the problem of emergence of replicators.
