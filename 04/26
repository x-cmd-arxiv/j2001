We determine that the current visual luminosity-to-mass ratio\nfor M82-F is 45 +/- 13. Comparison with spectral synthesis models shows that\nthe visual luminosity-to-mass ratio is a factor of 5 higher than that predicted\nfor a standard Kroupa (2001) initial mass function (IMF) at the well-determined\nage for M82-F of 60 +/- 20 Myr. This high value of the visual\nluminosity-to-mass ratio indicates a deficit of low mass stars in M82-F; the\ncurrent mass function (MF) evidently is `top-heavy'. We find that a lower mass\ncutoff of 2-3 solar masses is required to match the observations for a MF with\na slope of 2.3. Since the cluster apparently lacks long-lived low mass stars,\nit will not become an old globular cluster. We also derive up-dated\nluminosity-to-mass ratios for the younger SSCs NGC 1569A and NGC 1705-1. We\ndiscuss the implications of our findings in the context of large scale IMF\nvariations; with the present data the top-heavy MF could reflect a local mass\nsegregation effect during the birth of the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2001 13:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

It is known that, to any tensor A\non V there is a corresponding ``superenergy'' (s-e) tensor T{A} which always\nhas the dominant property. We prove that, conversely, any symmetric rank-2\ntensor with the dominant property can be written in a canonical way as a sum of\nN s-e tensors of simple forms. We show that the square of any rank-2 s-e tensor\nis proportional to the metric if N<5, and that this holds for the s-e tensor of\nany simple form for arbitrary N. Conversely, we prove that any symmetric rank-2\ntensor T whose square is proportional to the metric must be, up to sign, the\ns-e of a simple p-form, and that the trace of T determines the rank p of the\nform. This generalises, both with respect to N and the rank p, the classical\nalgebraic Rainich conditions, which are necessary and sufficient conditions for\na metric to originate in some physical field, and has a geometric\ninterpretation: the set of s-e tensors of simple forms is precisely the set of\ntensors which preserve the null cone and its time orientation.

We get an area law in most cases and try\nto identify its origin. In D3 case, we may identify the the origin as the D1\ndominance over the D3: as we go to the boundary of the AdS space, the effect of\nthe flux of the D3 charge is highly suppressed, while the flux due to the D1\ncharge is enhenced. So near the boundary the theory is more like a theory on D1\nbrane than that on D3 brane. This phenomena is closely related to the\ndimensional reduction due to the strong magnetic field in the charged particle\nin the magnetic field. The linear potential is not due to the confinement by IR\neffect but is the analogue of Coulomb's potential in 1+1 dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2001 08:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2001 11:54:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2001 01:12:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2001 13:36:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2001 08:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-28"}

Analysis reveals a\npossible physical origin for the converging behavior of solvation entropies for\na series of homologous hydrophobic compounds.

The coherent state labels, which are essentially instructions for\npreparing states, make it unnecessary to identify properties with projectors in\nHilbert space. This eliminates the so called \"eigenvalue-eigenstate\" link, and\nthe theory thereby escapes the measurement problem. What the theory allows us\nto predict is the distribution in the outcomes of tests of relations between\ncoherent states. It is shown that quantum non-determinism can be attributed to\na hidden variable (noise) in the space of relations without violating the no-go\ntheorems (e.g. Kochen-Specker). It is shown that the coherent state vacuum is\ndistorted when entangled states are generated. The non-locality of the vacuum\npermits this distortion to be felt everywhere without the transmission of a\nsignal and thereby accounts for EPR correlations in a manifestly covariant way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2001 21:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
