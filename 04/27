The spin-wave dispersion, which is almost\nperfectly 2D, has two branches due to a coupling between layers within a\ndouble-layer.

They interpolate\nbetween free superstring theories with periodic and antiperiodic boundary\nconditions for fermions around some compact direction, and, in particular,\nbetween type 0 and type II string theories. Using ``9-11 flip'', this\ninterpolation can be extended to M-theory and provides an interesting setting\nfor a study of tachyon problem in closed string theory. Starting with a general\n2-parameter family of such Melvin-type models, we present several new magnetic\nflux backgrounds in 10-d string theory and 11-d M-theory and discuss their\ntachyonic instabilities. In particular, we suggest a description of type 0B\ntheory in terms of M-theory in curved magnetic flux background, which supports\nits conjectured SL(2,Z) symmetry, and in which the type 0 tachyon appears to\ncorrespond to a state in 11-d supergravity multiplet. In another ``T-dual''\ndescription, the tachyon is related to a winding membrane state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2001 20:38:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2001 22:42:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 May 2001 22:42:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2001 10:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

This bifurcation\nchanges from supercritical (forward) to subcritical (backward) as a function of\nthe CGLE coefficients, and we show the relevance of this for the `phase\ndiagram'. Our findings indicate that in the zigzag parameter regime of the\nCGLE, the transition between defect-rich and defect-poor states is governed by\nbifurcations of the zigzag structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2001 12:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

After including initial\nand final-state nucleon-nucleon distortion, the magnitude and most of the\nenergy dependence are well reproduced. It is found that the contribution of\nrho-exchange is larger than that of pi-exchange. With destructive rho/pi\ninterference in the pp case, the model explains quantitatively the pp -> pp\neta/pn -> pn eta cross section ratio and the slope of the pp -> pp eta\ndifferential cross section. Such an agreement would be destroyed by any\nsignificant eta-exchange term. The residual energy dependence may be associated\nwith eta-nucleon rescattering that has not been taken into account. The pn ->\npn eta/pn -> d eta ratio depends weakly upon the nature of the particle\nexchanges, being determined primarily by the nucleon-nucleon final state\ninteractions.
