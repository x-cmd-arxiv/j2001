Here we present analytical\nrelations that can be used to investigate the effects of the uncertain gaseous\nvelocity dispersion on the HI flaring constraints. The contribution of cosmic\nrays and magnetic fields to the pressure gradients is small. A significantly\nflattened dark matter halo is only possible if R_0 <~ 6.8 kpc.\n  If R_0 is larger than ~7 kpc, or T_0 >~ 170 km/s, we can rule out two DM\ncandidates that require a highly flattened DM halo: 1) decaying massive\nneutrinos; and 2) a disk of cold molecular hydrogen.\n  It is only possible to construct self-consistent models of the Galaxy based\non the IAU-recommended values for the Galactic constants in the unlikely case\nthat the the stellar columndensity is smaller than ~18 M_sun/pc^2. If we assume\nthat the halo is oblate and S_* = 35 +/- 5 M_sun/pc^2, R_0 <~ 8 kpc and T_0 <~\n200 km/s.\n  Combining the best kinematical and star-count estimates of S_*, we conclude\nthat: 25 <~ S_* <~ 45 M_sun/pc^2. Kuijken & Gilmore's (1991) determination of\nthe columndensity of matter with |z|<=1.1 kpc is robust and valid over a wide\nrange of Galactic constants.\n  Our mass models show that the DM density in the Galactic centre is uncertain\nby a factor 1000. In the Solar neighbourhood we find: rho_DM ~0.42 GeV/c^2/cm^3\nor (11 +/- 5) mM_sun/pc^3 -- roughly 15% of rho_tot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2001 01:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The amplitudes of the\nspin signal allow the study of the spatial directions of the injected spin and\nits precession axis. Surprisingly efficient dynamic nuclear polarization in a\ngeometry where the electron spins are injected almost transverse to the applied\nmagnetic field is attributed to an enhanced non-precessing electron spin\ncomponent. The small absolute value of the electron g-factor combined with\nefficient nuclear spin polarization leads to large nuclear fields that dominate\nelectron spin precession at low temperatures.

Assume that $k_p=l_0$ so that\nthe convolution $A\\ast B$ is defined. We prove that $Det (A\\ast\nB)=Det(A)^{\\alpha}\\cdot Det(B)^{\\beta}$ where $\\alpha= \\frac {l_0!}{l_1!...\nl_q!}$, $\\beta=\\frac {(k_0+1)!}{k_1! ... k_{p-1}!(k_p+1)!}$ and $Det$ is the\nhyperdeterminant. When $A$, $B$ are square matrices this formula is the usual\nBinet-Cauchy Theorem computing the determinant of the product $A\\cdot B$. It\nfollows that $A \\ast B$ is nondegenerate if and only if $A$ and $B$ are both\nnondegenerate. We show by a counterexample that the assumption of boundary\nformat cannot be dropped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2001 11:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We study two quantum\nwalks on the n-dimensional hypercube, one in discrete time and one in\ncontinuous time. In both cases we show that the quantum walk mixes in (\\pi/4)n\nsteps, faster than the O(n log n) steps required by the classical walk. In the\ncontinuous-time case, the probability distribution is {\\em exactly} uniform at\nthis time. More importantly, these walks expose several subtleties in the\ndefinition of mixing time for quantum walks. Even though the continuous-time\nwalk has an O(n) instantaneous mixing time at which it is precisely uniform, it\nnever approaches the uniform distribution when the stopping time is chosen\nrandomly as in [AharonovAKV2001]. Our analysis treats interference between\nterms of different phase more carefully than is necessary for the walk on the\ncycle; previous general bounds predict an exponential, rather than linear,\nmixing time for the hypercube.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2001 00:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
