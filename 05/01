We pose the importance to seek the physically natural\nenvironment around GRB000214. For the reproduction of the observation, we need\nthe ring-like remnant around the progenitor like that of SN 1987A produced by\nthe mass-loss of the progenitor and the fireball spread over in every\ndirections. The observation of GRB000214, in which the continuum power law\nspectrum decreased faster than the line, motivated us to consider the two\nindependent systems for the line emission and the continuum spectrum. At first,\nthe continuum spectrum can be fitted by the afterglow emission of the fireball\npointing toward the observer which does not collide with the ring because the\nemission of GRB and the afterglow are highly collimated to the observer by the\nrelativistic beaming effect. Secondly, the line can be fitted by the\nfluorescence of the Fe atoms in the ring illuminated by the X-ray afterglow.\nThe significance of this study is that our model may constrain strongly the GRB\nmodel. Although the Supranova model assumes the extreme-ring-like remnant\nproduced by the usual supernova explosion, this may not be probable. It is\nbecause the supernova remnants are known to be shell-like. The model also\nassumes two steps of explosions, on the other hand, we need only one explosion\nof the progenitor. In this sense, our scenario is more natural. Moreover, in\nthe numerical simulations of Hypernova, the jet of the opening angle of only 1\ndegree is generated. In our model, the fireball which spreads over in every\ndirections reconciles with the observation of 1 percent of the polarization in\nthe observation of SN1998bw which showed the explosion might not be so\ncollimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2001 18:16:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 May 2001 00:38:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 27 May 2001 03:02:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2001 19:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

This is the\nhighest frequency QPO modulation seen to date from a black hole. The QPO is\ndetected only in the hard X-ray band above 13 keV. It is both strong and\nnarrow, with a typical rms amplitude of 4.5 % in the 13 - 27 keV range, and a\nwidth of 40 Hz (FWHM). For two observations in which we detect the 450 Hz QPO a\npreviously known 300 Hz QPO is also observed in the 2 - 13 keV band. We show\nthat these two QPO sometimes appear simultaneously, thus demonstrating the\nfirst detection of a pair of high frequency QPO in a black hole system. Prior\nto this, pairs of high frequency QPO have only been detected in neutron star\nsystems. GRO J1655-40 is one of only a handful of black hole systems with a\ngood dynamical mass constraint. For a non-rotating black hole with mass between\n5.5 - 7.9 solar masses, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) ranges from\n45 - 70 km. For any mass in this range the radius at which the orbital\nfrequency reaches 450 Hz is less than the ISCO radius, indicating that if the\nmodulation is caused by Kepler motion, the black hole must have appreciable\nspin. If the QPO frequency is set by the orbital frequency of matter at the\nISCO then for this mass range the dimensionless angular momentum lies between\n0.15 < j < 0.5. Moreover, if the modulation is caused by oscillation modes in\nthe disk or Lense-Thirring precession, then this would also require a rapidly\nrotating hole.

We combine these data with high-quality optical/IR\nphotometry beginning only three days after shock breakout, in order to study\nthe performance of the ``Expanding Photosphere Method'' (EPM) in the\ndetermination of distances. With this purpose we develop a technique to measure\naccurate photospheric velocities by cross-correlating observed and model\nspectra. The application of this technique to SN 1999em shows that we can reach\nan average uncertainty of 11% in velocity from an individual spectrum. Our\nanalysis shows that EPM is quite robust to the effects of dust. In particular,\nthe distances derived from the VI filters change by only 7% when the adopted\nvisual extinction in the host galaxy is varied by 0.45 mag. The superb time\nsampling of the BVIZJHK light-curves of SN 1999em permits us to study the\ninternal consistency of EPM and test the dilution factors computed from\natmosphere models for Type II plateau supernovae. We find that, in the first\nweek since explosion, the EPM distances are up to 50% lower than the average,\npossibly due the presence of circumstellar material. Over the following 65\ndays, on the other hand, our tests lend strong credence to the atmosphere\nmodels, and confirm previous claims that EPM can produce consistent distances\nwithout having to craft specific models to each supernova. This is particularly\ntrue for the VI filters which yield distances with an internal consistency of\n4%. From the whole set of BVIZJHK photometry, we obtain an average distance of\n7.5+/-0.5 Mpc, where the quoted uncertainty (7%) is a conservative estimate of\nthe internal precision of the method obtained from the analysis of the first 70\ndays of the supernova evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2001 02:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
