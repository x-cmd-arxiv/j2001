The first set is based on the Nijmegen\nhard core potential model D with slightly attractive $YY$ interactions. The\nsecond potential set is based on the recent SU(3) extension of the Nijmegen\nsoft-core potential NSC97 with strongly attractive $YY$ interactions which may\nallow for deeply bound hypernuclear matter. The results show that, for the\nfirst potential set, the $\\Sigma$ hyperon does not appear at all in the bulk at\nany baryon density and for all strangeness fractions. The binding energy curves\nof the resulting $N\\Lambda\\Xi$ system vary smoothly with density and the system\nis stable (or metastable if we include the weak force). However, the situation\nis drastically changed when using the second set where the $\\Sigma$ hyperons\nappear in the system at large baryon densities above a critical strangeness\nfraction. We find strange hadronic matter undergoes a first order phase\ntransition from a $N\\Lambda\\Xi$ system to a $N\\Sigma\\Xi$ for strangeness\nfractions $f_S>1.2$ and baryonic densities exceeding twice ordinary nuclear\nmatter density. Furthermore, it is found that the system built of $N\\Sigma\\Xi$\nis deeply bound. This phase transition affects significantly the equation of\nstate which becomes much softer and a substantial drop in energy density and\npressure are detected as the phase transition takes place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2001 12:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
