There are several proposals for improving the precision of such\nan analysis by exploiting type information, icluding our own work with Hill and\nKing, where we had shown how the information present in the type declarations\nof a program can be used to characterise the degree of instantiation of a term\nin a precise and yet inherently finite way. This approach worked for\npolymorphically typed programs as in Goedel or HAL. Here, we recast this\napproach following works by Codish, Lagoon and Stuckey. To formalise which\nproperties of terms we want to characterise, we use labelling functions, which\nare functions that extract subterms from a term along certain paths. An\nabstract term collects the results of all labelling functions of a term. For\nthe analysis, programs are executed on abstract terms instead of the concrete\nones, and usual unification is replaced by unification modulo an equality\ntheory which includes the well-known ACI-theory. Thus we generalise the works\nby Codish, Lagoon and Stuckey w.r.t. the type systems considered and relate the\nworks among each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2001 10:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Roughly speaking, this rational presentation of\nthe Kontsevich integral would sum formal power series into rational functions\nwith prescribed denominators. Rozansky's conjecture was soon proven by the\nsecond author. We begin our paper by reviewing Rozansky's conjecture and the\nmain ideas that lead to its proof. The natural question of extending this\nconjecture to links leads to the class of boundary links, and a proof of\nRozansky's conjecture in this case. A subtle issue is the fact that a `hair'\nmap which replaces beads by the exponential of hair is not 1-1. This raises the\nquestion of whether a rational invariant of boundary links exists in an\nappropriate space of trivalent graphs whose edges are decorated by rational\nfunctions in noncommuting variables. A main result of the paper is to construct\nsuch an invariant, using the so-called surgery view of boundary links and after\ndeveloping a formal diagrammatic Gaussian integration.\n  Since our invariant is one of many rational forms of the Kontsevich integral,\none may ask if our invariant is in some sense canonical. We prove that this is\nindeed the case, by axiomatically characterizing our invariant as a universal\nfinite type invariant of boundary links with respect to the null move. Finally,\nwe discuss relations between our rational invariant and homology surgery, and\ngive some applications to low dimensional topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2001 19:28:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2001 17:43:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2003 13:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2004 21:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

The resulting field equations become the traditional\nNewton's equations when week gravitational effects are present. The theory\ncomplies with all the known experimental results such as the gravitational time\ndilation and faster light speeds higher in the gravitational field. The special\nrelativity theory of an object moving without experiencing gravitational fields\ncan be derived directly from the gravitational field equations introduced here.\nThe theory introduced here has crucial differences to Einstein's general\nrelativity theory. For example, the gravitational field cannot accelerate an\nobject to higher than the speed of light and the event horizon of a black hole\n(where light cannot escape) has to be of zero radius, essentially meaning that\nlight can escape any object unless the object has infinite density. Another\nprimary consequence of this study is that the principle of equivalence of\ngravitational and inertial mass has only limited validity and a new definition\nof gravitational mass is given here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2001 23:10:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 May 2001 22:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
