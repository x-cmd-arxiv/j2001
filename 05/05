In this case, planets C and D inhabit a secular\nresonance in which Delta-omega librates about 0 deg with an amplitude of 30 deg\nand a period of 4000 yr.

We show that emission\nfrom the afterglow of GRB980703 is expected to be one to two orders of\nmagnitude fainter, and therefore cannot account for these observations. We\ninterpret this persistent emission as coming from the host galaxy --- the first\nexample of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) host detection at radio wavelengths. We show\nthat emission from an AGN is unlikely, and find that it can be explained as a\nresult of a star-formation rate (SFR) of massive stars (M>5M$_\\odot$) of 90\nM$_\\odot$/yr, which gives a total SFR of $\\approx 500$ M$_\\odot$/yr.

The isotopes present a quite similar behavior for the loss rates at\nhigh intensities, and a sudden increase of the loss rates at low intensities is\npresent in both cases. While for 39K such increase can be explained assuming\nthat the major contribution to the losses comes from Hyperfine Changing\nCollisions, a different loss mechanism must be considered for 40K, which has an\ninverted ground state hyperfine structure. The experimental results of both\nisotopes are well reproduced by an alternative model based on radiative escape\nas the dominant loss mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2001 22:10:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
