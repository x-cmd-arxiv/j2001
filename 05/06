The neutrino beam carries almost all\nof the emitted energy, but is much narrower than the GRB beam and should only\nbe detected in coincidence with the small fraction of GRBs whose CBs are moving\nvery close to the line of sight.

We prove\nthat if at least 10% of this excess is due to gamma-ray radiation with\ncontinuum energy spectrum from neutralino annihilations in the model under\ninvestigation, the associated gamma-ray line will be detected by upcoming\ngamma-ray experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2001 13:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-03"}

The relation states that the form factor\nat a given value of $Q^2$ is proportional to the scattering amplitude at a\nspecific energy and scattering angle. This suggests that an accurate\ncomputation of the form factors at large $Q^2$ requires a simultaneous\ndescription of the phase-shifts at a related energy, a statement that seems\nreasonable regardless of any derivation. Our form factor-scattering amplitude\nrelation is shown to be accurate for some examples. However, if the potential\nconsists of a strong short distance repulsive term and a strong longer ranged\nattractive term, as typically occurs in many realistic potentials, the relation\nis found to be accurate only for ridiculously large values of $Q$. More general\narguments, using only the Schroedinger equation, suggest a strong, but\ncomplicated, relationship between the form factor and scattering amplitude.\nFurthermore, the use of recently obtained soft potentials, along with an\nappropriate current operator, may allow calculations of form factors that are\nconsistent with the necessary phase shifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2001 00:16:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2004 01:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
