Unlike BL Lacs from the complete X-ray-selected Einstein\nMedium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS) sample (XBLs), most RBLs possess weak but\nmoderately luminous emission lines. And whereas nearly all XBLs have extended\npower levels consistent with FR-1s, more than half of the RBLs have extended\nradio power levels too luminous to be beamed FR-1 radio galaxies. In fact, we\nfind evidence for and examples of three distinct mechanisms for creating the BL\nLac phenomenon in the 1Jy sample: beamed FR-1s, beamed FR-2s and possibly a few\ngravitationally-lensed quasars. The v/v_max determined for the 1Jy sample is\n0.614+/-0.047, which is markedly different from the negative evolution seen in\nthe EMSS and other XBL samples. A correlation between logarithmic X-ray to\nradio flux ratio and v/v_max is observed across the EMSS and 1Jy samples, from\nnegative evolution in the more extreme XBLs to positive evolution in the more\nextreme RBLs. There is evidence that the selection criteria chosen by Stickel\net al. eliminates some BL Lac objects from the 1Jy sample, although how many is\nunknown. And several objects currently in the sample have exhibited strong\nemission lines in one or more epochs, suggesting they should be reclassified as\nFSRQs.
