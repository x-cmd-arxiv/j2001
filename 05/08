Offline analysis on the 64-node Swinburne workstation cluster\nresulted in the detection of 170 pulsars of which 69 were new discoveries.\nEight of the new pulsars, by virtue of their small spin periods and period\nderivatives, may be recycled and have been reported elsewhere. The slow pulsars\ndiscovered are typical of those already known in the volume searched, being of\nintermediate to old age. Several pulsars experience pulse nulling and two\ndisplay very regular drifting sub-pulses. We discuss the new discoveries and\nprovide timing parameters for the 48 slow pulsars for which we have a\nphase-connnected solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2001 11:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The hypernova yields compared to those of ordinary core-collapse\nsupernovae show the following characteristics: 1) Complete Si-burning takes\nplace in more extended region, so that the mass ratio between the complete and\nincomplete Si burning regions is generally larger in hypernovae than normal\nsupernovae. As a result, higher energy explosions tend to produce larger [(Zn,\nCo)/Fe], small [(Mn, Cr)/Fe], and larger [Fe/O], which could explain the trend\nobserved in very metal-poor stars. 2) Si-burning takes place in lower density\nregions, so that the effects of $\\alpha$-rich freezeout is enhanced. Thus\n$^{44}$Ca, $^{48}$Ti, and $^{64}$Zn are produced more abundantly than in normal\nsupernovae. The large [(Ti, Zn)/Fe] ratios observed in very metal poor stars\nstrongly suggest a significant contribution of hypernovae. 3) Oxygen burning\nalso takes place in more extended regions for the larger explosion energy. Then\na larger amount of Si, S, Ar, and Ca (\"Si\") are synthesized, which makes the\n\"Si\"/O ratio larger.

The model was shown to approximate\nto the model of Freese {\\it et al}. in one direction and to the \\\"{O}zer-Taha\nin the other. We have then included the effect of viscosity in this cosmology,\nas this effect has not been considered before. The analysis showed that this\nviscous effect could be important with a present contribution to the cosmic\npressure, at most, of order of that of radiation. The model puts a stronger\nupper bound on the baryonic matter than that required by the standard model. A\nvariable gravitational and cosmological constant were then introduced in a\nscenario which conserves the energy and momentum in the presence of bulk\nviscosity. The result of the analysis reveals that various models could be\nviscous. A noteworthy result is that some nonsingular closed models evolve\nasymptotically into a singular viscous one. The considered models solve for\nmany of the standard model problems. Though the introduction of bulk viscosity\nresults in the creation of particles, this scenario conserves energy and\nmomentum. As in the standard model the entropy remains constant. We have not\nexplained the generation of bulk viscosity but some workers attributes this to\nneutrinos. Though the role of viscosity today is minute it could, nevertheless,\nhave had an important contribution at early times. We have shown that these\nmodels encompass many of the old and recently proposed models, in particular,\nBrans-Dicke, Dirac, Freese {\\it et al}., Berman, Abdel Rahman and Kalligas {\\it\net al}. models. Hence we claim that the introduction of bulk viscosity enriches\nthe adopted cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2001 09:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-15"}

The results are reported for quantum bits (qubits)\ncoupling individually to different environments (`independent decoherence') and\nqubits interacting collectively with the same reservoir (`collective\ndecoherence'). In both cases, explicit decoherence functions are derived for\nany number of qubits. The decay of the coherences of the register is shown to\nstrongly depend on the input states: we show that this sensitivity is a\ncharacteristic of $both$ types of coupling (collective and independent) and not\nonly of the collective coupling, as has been reported previously. A non-trivial\nbehaviour (\"recoherence\") is found in the decay of the off-diagonal elements of\nthe reduced density matrix in the specific situation of independent\ndecoherence. Our results lead to the identification of decoherence-free states\nin the collective decoherence limit. These states belong to subspaces of the\nsystem's Hilbert space that do not get entangled with the environment, making\nthem ideal elements for the engineering of ``noiseless'' quantum codes.
