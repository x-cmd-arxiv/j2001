It is known since the early to mid\nnineteen eightees that the supersymmetric electro-weak correction to $a_{\\mu}$\ncan be as large or larger than the Standard Model electro-weak correction and\nthus any experiment that proposes to test the Standard Model electro-weak\ncorrection will also test the supersymmetric correction and constrain\nsupersymmetric models. The new physics effect seen in the Brookhaven (BNL)\nexperiment is consistent with these early expectations. Detailed analyses\nwithin the well motivated supergravity unified model show that the size of the\nobserved difference ($a_{\\mu}^{exp}-a_{\\mu}^{SM}$) seen at Brookhaven implies\nupper limits on sparticle masses in a mass range accessible to the direct\nobservation of these particles at the Large Hadron Collider. Further, analyses\nalso show that the BNL data is favorable for the detection of supersymmeteric\ndark matter in direct dark matter searches. The effect of large extra\ndimensions on $a_{\\mu}$ is also discussed. It is shown that with the current\nlimits on the size of extra dimensions, which imply that the inverse size of\nsuch dimensions lies in the TeV region, their effects on $a_{\\mu}$ relative to\nthe supersymmetric contribution is small and thus extra dimensions do not\nproduce a serious background to the supersymmetric contribution.

Such attractors are generic in quasiperiodically driven\nnonlinear systems, and like strange attractors, are geometrically fractal. The\nlargest Lyapunov exponent is zero or negative: trajectories do not show\nexponential sensitivity to initial conditions. In recent years, SNAs have been\nseen in a number of diverse experimental situations ranging from\nquasiperiodically driven mechanical or electronic systems to plasma discharges.\nAn important connection is the equivalence between a quasiperiodically driven\nsystem and the Schr\\\"odinger equation for a particle in a related quasiperiodic\npotential, giving a correspondence between the localized states of the quantum\nproblem with SNAs in the related dynamical system. In this review we discuss\nthe main conceptual issues in the study of SNAs, including the different\nbifurcations or routes for the creation of such attractors, the methods of\ncharacterization, and the nature of dynamical transitions in quasiperiodically\nforced systems. The variation of the Lyapunov exponent, and the qualitative and\nquantitative aspects of its local fluctuation properties, has emerged as an\nimportant means of studying fractal attractors, and this analysis finds useful\napplication here. The ubiquity of such attractors, in conjunction with their\nseveral unusual properties, suggest novel applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2001 05:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Labeling by introducing\nnonsymmetry and formatting by introducing symmetry are defined. The function L\n(L=lnw, w is the number of microstates, or the sum of entropy and information,\nL=S+I) of the universe is a constant (the first law of information theory). The\nentropy S of the universe tends toward a maximum (the second law law of\ninformation theory). For a perfect symmetric static structure, the information\nis zero and the static entropy is the maximum (the third law law of information\ntheory). Based on the Gibbs inequality and the second law of the revised\ninformation theory we have proved the similarity principle (a continuous higher\nsimilarity-higher entropy relation after the rejection of the Gibbs paradox)\nand proved the Curie-Rosen symmetry principle (a higher symmetry-higher\nstability relation) as a special case of the similarity principle. Some\nexamples in chemical physics have been given. Spontaneous processes of all\nkinds of molecular interaction, phase separation and phase transition,\nincluding symmetry breaking and the densest molecular packing and\ncrystallization, are all driven by information minimization or symmetry\nmaximization. The evolution of the universe in general and evolution of life in\nparticular can be quantitatively considered as a series of symmetry breaking\nprocesses. The two empirical rules - similarity rule and complementarity rule -\nhave been given a theoretical foundation. All kinds of periodicity in space and\ntime are symmetries and contribute to the stability. Symmetry is beautiful\nbecause it renders stability. However, symmetry is in principle ugly because it\nis associated with information loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2001 06:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
