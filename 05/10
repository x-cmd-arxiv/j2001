By performing local two-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations of disks, we demonstrate that convective motions can\nrelease heat sufficiently rapidly as to substantially alter the vertical\nstructure of the disk. If the dissipation rate within a vertical column is\nproportional to its mass, the disk settles into a new configuration thinner by\na factor of two than the standard radiation-supported equilibrium. If, on the\nother hand, the vertically-integrated dissipation rate is proportional to the\nvertically-integrated total pressure, the disk is subject to the well-known\nthermal instability.

Particles,\naccelerated in the shock via the first order Fermi process, are supposed to\ncool by inverse Compton process on external soft photons, resulting in a\ncut-off power law shape of the particle distribution function. The high energy\nphotons produced are thus able to create pairs, through photon-photon\nannihilation. The increase of the pair pressure may then be sufficient to\nmodify the shock profile. We show that there is even a limit of the pair\npressure (of the order of 20% of the ram pressure of the upstream flow) above\nwhich the shock cannot exist any longer. Conversely, significant changes of the\nflow velocity profile will also modify the spectral index and the high energy\ncut--off of the particle distribution function. Hence the number of particles\nable to trigger the pair creation process will change, modifying the pair\ncreation rate accordingly. Taking into account these different processes, we\nself-consistently derive the flow velocity profile and the particle\ndistribution function.

In contrast, most of the current theoretical models rely on the role of the\nE2g phonon in the electron-phonon coupling mechanism of superconductivity in\nMgB2. According to these models, a hardening of 12% is expected below Tc at the\nGamma point of the Brillouim zone. In the presence of our results, those models\nmust be reviewed. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the E2g phonon\nfrequency yields to a isobaric Gruneisen parameter of -1.2< gama(E2g)< 0.2,\nsmaller than the value of 3.9 obtained from isothermal Raman experiments under\npressure. It is suggested that this apparent disagreement can be explained in\nterms of pressure induced changes of the topology of the Fermi surface. Finally\nwe notice that the phonon linewidth presents the expected two-phonon anharmonic\ndecay as a function of T and no anomalous temperature dependence of the\nlinewidth is observed near Tc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2001 21:16:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2001 20:24:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2002 19:23:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2002 12:22:33 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2002 19:56:19 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2004 18:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

An \"equivalence theorem\" shows that a very light spin-1 U boson with\nnon-vanishing axial couplings does not in general decouple even when its gauge\ncoupling vanishes, but behaves as a quasimassless pseudoscalar. (This\nequivalence theorem is similar to the one of supersymmetry/supergravity\ntheories, according to which a very light spin-3/2 gravitino might get\ndetectable as a quasi massless spin-1/2 goldstino, despite the extreme\nsmallness of Newton's gravitational constant G_N.)

The source\nintroduced at the excision surface between the interior and exterior geometries\nbehaves exactly as a shell of wrapped D6-branes, and in particular, the tension\nvanishes at precisely the enhancon radius. These observations can be\ngeneralised, and we present the case for non-extremal generalisations of the\ngeometry, showing that the procedure allows for the possibility that the\ninterior geometry contains an horizon. Further knowledge of the dynamics of the\nenhancon shell itself is needed to determine the precise position of the\nhorizon, and to uncover a complete physical interpretation of the solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2001 19:01:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2001 20:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The purpose of this paper is\nto determine the threshold of the break-up of invariant tori with a specific\nfrequency vector. We apply two techniques: the frequency map analysis and\nrenormalization-group methods. The renormalization transformation acting on a\nHamiltonian is a canonical change of coordinates which is a combination of a\npartial elimination of the irrelevant modes of the Hamiltonian and a rescaling\nof phase space around the considered torus. We give numerical evidence that the\ncritical coupling at which the renormalization transformation starts to diverge\nis the same as the value given by the frequency map analysis for the break-up\nof invariant tori. Furthermore, we obtain by these methods numerical values of\nthe threshold of the break-up of the last invariant torus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2001 15:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
