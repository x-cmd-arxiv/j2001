We find that the principal\naxes of I and T are strongly aligned, even though I characterizes the\nproto-halo locally while T is determined by the large-scale structure. Thus,\nthe resultant galactic spin, which plays a key role in galaxy formation, is\nonly a residual due to ~10 per cent deviations from perfect alignment of T and\nI. The T-I correlation induces a weak tendency for the proto-halo spin to be\nperpendicular to the major axes of T and I, but this correlation is erased by\nnon-linear effects at late times, making the observed spins poor indicators of\nthe initial shear field. However, the T-I correlation implies that the shear\ntensor can be used for identifying the positions and boundaries of proto-haloes\nin cosmological initial conditions -- a missing piece in galaxy formation\ntheory. The typical configuration is of a prolate proto-halo lying\nperpendicular to a large-scale high-density ridge, with the surrounding voids\ninducing compression along the major and intermediate inertia axes of the\nproto-halo. This leads to a transient sub-halo filament along the large-scale\nridge, whose sub-clumps then flow along the filament and merge into the final\nhalo. The centres of proto-haloes tend to lie in ~1 sigma over-density regions,\nbut their association with linear density maxima smoothed on galactic scales is\nvague: only ~40 per cent of the proto-haloes contain peaks within them.

The behavior of the source during\nthe observations can be divided into two distinct state types. During the hard\nstate, the energy spectra are relatively hard and can be described by only a\npower-law component, and the characteristic frequencies (i.e., the frequency of\nthe 1-7 Hz QPOs observed for the first time in this source) in the power\nspectra are low. However, during the ``soft'' state, the spectra are\nconsiderably softer (in addition to the power-law component, a soft component\nis necessary to fit the spectra) and the frequencies are the highest observed.\nRemarkably, this distinction into two separate states cannot be extrapolated to\nalso include the 3-20 keV X-ray luminosity. Except for one observation, this\nluminosity steadily decreased but the hard state was observed both at the\nhighest and lowest observed luminosities.

We\nshow how to realize this theory in a learning system named CFRule. CFRule is a\nparallel weight-based model, but it departs from traditional neural computing\nin that its internal knowledge is comprehensible. Furthermore, when the model\nconverges upon training, each channel converges to a target rule. The model\nadaptation rule is derived by multi-level parallel weight optimization based on\ngradient descent. Since, however, gradient descent only guarantees local\noptimization, a multi-channel regression-based optimization strategy is\ndeveloped to effectively deal with this problem. Formally, we prove that the\nCFRule model can explicitly and precisely encode any given rule set. Also, we\nprove a property related to asynchronous parallel convergence, which is a\ncritical element of the multi-channel parallel adaptation theory for rule\nlearning. Thanks to the quantizability nature of the CFRule model, rules can be\nextracted completely and soundly via a threshold-based mechanism.

Time-dependent perturbation theory allows us to obtain an explicit\nsolution of the harmonic problem: even in such a simple system nontrivial\nfeatures emerge from the interplay of the different decay rates of Fourier\nmodes. In particular, a crossover from an exponential to an inverse-square-root\nlaw occurs on a time scale proportional to the system size $N$. A further\ncrossover back to an exponential law is observed only at much longer times (of\nthe order $N^3$). In the nonlinear chain, the relaxation process is initially\nequivalent to the harmonic case over a wide time span, as illustrated by\nsimulations of the $\\beta$ Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model. The distinctive feature is\nthat the second crossover is not observed due to the spontaneous appearance of\nbreathers, i.e. space-localized time-periodic solutions, that keep a finite\nresidual energy in the lattice. We discuss the mechanism yielding such\nsolutions and also explain why it crucially depends on the boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2001 18:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

Khrapko proposed a gauge noninvariant electrodynamics\nspin tensor (``Spin density of electromagnetic waves''). The standard\nelectrodynamics spin tensor is zero.\n  Here we point out that the Biot-Savarat formula uniquely results in a\npreferred, \"true\" vector potential field which is generated from a given\nmagnetic field. A similar integral formula uniquely permits to find a \"true\"\nscalar potential field generated from a given electric field even in the case\nof a nonpotential electric field.\n  A conception of differential forms is used. We say that an exterior\nderivative of a form is the boundary of this form and the integration of a form\nby the Biot-Savarat-type formula results in a new form named the generation.\nGenerating from a generation yields zero. The boundary of a boundary is zero. A\nboundary is closed. A generation is sterile. A conjugation is considered. The\nconjugation converts closed forms to sterile forms and back. It permits to\nconstruct chains of forms. The conjunction differs from the Hodge star\noperation: the conjugation does not imply the dualization.
