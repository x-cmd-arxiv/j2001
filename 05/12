The average color\nof GCSs in all 29 S0 galaxies, V-I=1.00 +/- 0.07 mag, is similar to the value\nof V-I=1.04 +/- 0.04 derived for ellipticals in a companion paper. The mean\nmetallicity of a cluster system is correlated to the luminosity (or mass) of\nthe host galaxy, but is not dependent on the Hubble type. Our measurements of\nthe local specific frequency, on the other hand, confirm that the cluster\nformation efficiency is a function of Hubble type. The mean local specific\nfrequency of our sample within the WFPC2 field-of-view is 1.0 +/- 0.6, lower\nthan S_(N Local)=2.4 +/- 1.8 derived for ellipticals in a similar analysis.\nAlthough we are able to confirm a bimodal color distribution in only one galaxy\nfrom the shallow 'snapshot' images analyzed in this paper statistical tests\nsuggest that 10-20% of S0s are bimodal it at the present level of photometric\naccuracy. There are no significant trends in GCS properties with membership or\nlocation of the S0 host in a galaxy cluster. We have measured the turnover\nluminosity of the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) for the richest\nfew GCSs and find the GCLF distances to be in agreement with other estimates.\nThe globular clusters in S0 galaxies have average half-light radii of ~2.6 pc\nwhich is similar to that of other galaxies, including our own.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2001 21:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The [O III] emission\nfollows the H-beta emission measure; however, the O II emission peaks closer to\nthe central star. This suggests that radiative recombination may not be the\nprimary mechanism for producing the O II lines. O+2 abundances derived from O\nII lines are 5-10 times larger than those derived from [O III] in the region\nwithin 20\" of the central star, but agree to within 0.2-0.3 dex outside this\nregion.

If temperature\nfluctuations are responsible for the discrepancy in O+2 abundances, the average\ntemperature would have to be approximately 6,500 K in the He$^{+2}$ zone and\nabout 9,000 K in the outer shell in order to force the [O III]-derived\nabundance to equal that derived from O II.

We demonstrate that the shock\nfront is unstable to the generation of small-scale, randomly tangled magnetic\nfields. These fields are strong enough to scatter the energetic incoming (in\nthe shock frame) protons and electrons over pitch angle and, therefore, to\nconvert their kinetic energy of bulk motion into heat with very high\nefficiency. This validates the use of MHD approximation and the shock jump\nconditions in particular. The effective collisions are also necessary for the\ndiffusive Fermi acceleration of electrons to operate and produce an observed\npower-law. Finally, these strong (sub-equipartition) magnetic fields are also\nrequired for the efficient synchrotron-type radiation emission from the shocks.\n  The predicted magnetic fields have an impact on polarization properties of\nthe observed radiation (e.g., a linear polarization from a jet-like ejecta and\npolarization scintillations in radio for a spherical one) and on its spectrum.\nWe present an analytical theory of jitter radiation, which is emitted when the\nmagnetic field is correlated on scales smaller then the gyration (Larmor)\nradius of the accelerated electrons.

Nevertheless, applications such as evolutionary theory demand\nconsideration of precisely this aspect of information, a need that has\nmotivated a largely unsuccessful search for a suitable measure of an \"amount of\nmeaning\". This paper represents an attempt to move beyond this impasse, based\non the observation that the meaning of a message can only be understood\nrelative to its receiver. Positing that the semantic value of information is\nits usefulness in making an informed decision, we define pragmatic information\nas the information gain in the probability distributions of the receiver's\nactions, both before and after receipt of a message in some pre-defined\nensemble. We then prove rigorously that our definition is the only one that\nsatisfies obvious desiderata, such as the additivity of information from\nlogically independent messages. This definition, when applied to the\ninformation \"learned\" by the time evolution of a process, defies the intuitions\nof the few previous researchers thinking along these lines by being monotonic\nin the uncertainty that remains after receipt of the message, but non-monotonic\nin the Shannon entropy of the input ensemble. It then follows that the\npragmatic information of the genetic \"messages\" in an evolving population is a\nglobal Lyapunov function for Eigen's quasi-species model of biological\nevolution. A concluding section argues that a theory such as ours must\nexplicitly acknowledge purposeful action, or \"agency\", in such diverse fields\nas evolutionary theory and finance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2001 16:33:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2002 22:12:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2003 16:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
