We have carried out\nnear-IR observations with ADONIS at the ESO 3.6m but have not detected any\nlate-type companions close to HD127971 and HD129791. This result leads us to\nconclude that either (i) they are spectroscopic binaries with unresolved\nlow-mass companions, or (ii) they are intrinsic X-ray emitters. While the\nformer case would be consistent with the reported high multiplicity of\nearly-type (A and B) stars, the latter would yield a revision of stellar\nactivity theories which do not predict X-ray emission from these stars. On the\nother hand, HD123445 does indeed show visual companions, namely an apparent\nsubarcsecond faint (Ks=10mag) binary system at a projected separation of 5\"\nfrom the late-B type star. The JHKs magnitudes and colors of the components are\nconsistent with a pair of Pre Main Sequence (PMS) K-type stars at 140 pc, i.e.\npossible members of the Upper Centaurus Lupus association. In this case the\nreported X-ray emission can be ascribed to the new binary system. Nevertheless,\nspectroscopy is required to confirm the possible PMS nature of the pair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 May 2001 22:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

It shows itself\nin the form of trajectories that spend a long time near a symmetric state\ninterspersed with short bursts away from symmetry. In contrast to on-off\nintermittency, there are clearly distinct mechanisms of approach towards and\naway from the symmetric state, and this needs to be taken into account in order\nto properly model the long time statistics. We do this by using a\ndiffusion-type equation with delay integral boundary condition. This model is\nvalidated by considering the statistics of a two-dimensional map with and\nwithout the addition of noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 May 2001 20:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
