Although the problem of Coulomb corrections for DIS\non nuclei is extremely difficult, it should be challenged rather than 'swept\nunder the carpet'.

We show that in the simplest case of a constant hadronic\ncurrent the Coulomb corrections provide a phase to the Born amplitude,\ntherefore the cross section remains the same.

Through a simple transformation, this equation can be\nconverted into an iterative two dimensional skew--product mapping of the\ncylinder to itself. Localized states of the Harper system correspond to fractal\nattractors with nonpositive maximal Lyapunov exponent in the dynamics of the\nassociated Harper map. We study this map and these strange nonchaotic\nattractors (SNAs) in detail in this paper. The spectral gaps of the Harper\nsystem have a unique labeling through a topological invariant of orbits of the\nHarper map. This labeling associates an integer index with each gap, and the\nscaling properties of the width of the gaps as a function of potential\nstrength, $\\epsilon$ depends on the index. SNAs occur in a large region in\nparameter space: these regions have a tongue--like shape and end on a Cantor\nset on the line $\\epsilon = 1$ where the states are critically localized, and\nthe spectrum is singular continuous. The SNAs of the Harper map are described\nin terms of their fractal properties, and the scaling behaviour of their\npower--spectra. These are created by unusual bifurcations and differ in many\nrespects from SNAs that have hitherto been studied. The technique of studying a\nquantum eigenvalue problem in terms of the dynamics of an associated mapping\ncan be applied to a number of related problems in 1~dimension.
