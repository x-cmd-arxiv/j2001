Our investigation includes twelve galaxies of\nvarious types and in different stages of star forming activity.\n  The main results of this CO(3-2) survey are: 1. In none of the observed\nobjects the emission is confined to the nucleus, as claimed in some earlier\npublications. CO(3-2) emission can be detected for some objects to the same\nextent as the CO(2-1) and the CO(1-0) lines. 2. The emission is more\nconcentrated to the vicinity of star forming structures than the lower CO\ntransitions. This is shown by decreasing line ratios from the very centres\ntowards larger radii. 3. The CO(3-2) luminosity is stronger in objects that\ncontain a nuclear starburst or morphological peculiarities. 4. The line ratios\nseem to be independent of Hubble type, color or luminosity. Most galaxies with\nenhanced central star formation show line ratios of ~1.3 in the very centre and\n\\~1.0 at a radius of about 1kpc. Objects with a ring-like molecular gas\ndistribution or normal galaxies show lower ratios. 5. Starburst galaxies show\nCO(3-2) emission also in their disks. The line intensities there are higher\nthan that of normal galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2001 10:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
