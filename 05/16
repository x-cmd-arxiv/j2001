Our VLA images at 1.4 GHz with 4\" resolution show a\nremarkable variety of fine structure in the form of spectacular arcs, wisps,\nplumes and loops. Their integrated radio flux densities fall very rapidly with\nfrequency, with power-law slopes between 2.1 and 4.4 near 1.4 GHz The relics\npossess linear polarization levels ranging between 2.3 % (A133) and 35 % (A85);\nthe higher polarization fractions imply a highly ordered magnetic field in the\nfine structure and low differential Faraday rotation in the intervening cluster\ngas. The optical identification of host galaxies remains problematic. In A85,\nA133 and A4038 the travel times for the brightest cluster galaxies are\nsignificantly longer than the modeled ages of the relics and nearby bright\nellipticals provide a better match. Excess X-ray emission in the 0.5 keV-to-2\nkeV band was found near the relics in A85 and A133. The surface brightness was\ntoo high to be attributed to the inverse-Compton mechanism alone.

The NH3 images have a spatial resolution\nof 16.5''x14.5'' and have better spatial sampling than previous NH3\nobservations. The images show the ``southern streamer,'' ``50 km/s cloud,'' and\nnew features including a ``western streamer'', 6 parsecs in length, and a\n``northern ridge'' which connects to the CND. NH3(3,3) emission is very similar\nto 1.2 mm dust emission indicating that NH3 traces column density well. Ratios\nof the NH3(2,2) to (1,1) line intensities give an estimate of the temperature\nof the gas and indicate high temperatures close to the nucleus and CND. The new\ndata cover a velocity range of 270 km/s, including all velocities observed in\nthe CND, with a resolution of 9.8 km/s. Previous NH3 observations with higher\nresolution did not cover the entire range of velocities seen in the CND. The\nlarge-scale kinematics of the CND do not resemble a coherent ring or disk. We\nsee evidence for a high velocity cloud within a projected distance of 50'' (2\npc) which is only seen in NH3(3,3) and is likely to be hot.
