Although the UVB\ndoes suppress the formation of low mass objects, the negative feedback turns\nout to be weaker than previously suggested. In particular, the cut-off scale of\ncollapse drops significantly below the virial temperature 10^4 K at weak UV\nintensities, due to both self-shielding of the gas and H2 cooling. Clouds above\nthis cut-off tend to contract highly dynamically, further promoting\nself-shielding and H2 formation. For plausible radiation intensities and\nspectra, the collapsing gas can cool efficiently to temperatures well below\n10^4 K before rotationally supported and the final H2 fraction reaches 10^{-3}.\nOur results imply that star formation can take place in low mass objects\ncollapsing in the UVB. The threshold baryon mass for star formation is \\sim\n10^9 solar mass for clouds collapsing at redshifts z \\simlt 3, but drops\nsignificantly at higher redshifts. In a conventional cold dark matter universe,\nthe latter coincides roughly with that of the 1 \\sigma density fluctuations.\nObjects near and above this threshold can thus constitute `building blocks' of\nluminous structures, and we discuss their links to dwarf spheroidal/elliptical\ngalaxies and faint blue objects. These results suggest that the UVB can play a\nkey role in regulating the star formation history of the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2001 00:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

The so-called\ncanonical or warp metric in 5D effectively converts the manifold from a\ncoordinate space to a momentum space, resulting in a new force (per unit mass)\nparallel to the 4D velocity. The form of this extra force is actually\nindependent of the form of the metric, but for an unbound particle is tiny\nbecause it is set by the energy density of the vacuum or cosmological constant.\nIt can be related to a small change in the rest mass of a particle, and can be\nevaluated in two convenient gauges relevant to gravitational and quantum\nsystems. In the quantum gauge, the extra force leads to Heisenberg's relation\nbetween increments in the position and momenta. If the 4D action is quantized\nthen so is the higher-dimensional part, implying that particle mass is\nquantized, though only at a level of 10^{-65} gm or less which is unobservably\nsmall. It is noted that massive particles which move on timeline paths in 4D\ncan move on null paths in 5D. This agrees with the view from inflationary\nquantum field theory, that particles acquire mass dynamically in 4D but are\nintrinsically massless. A general prescription for dynamics is outlined,\nwherein particles move on null paths in an N(>4)D manifold which may be flat,\nbut have masses set by an embedded 4D manifold which is curved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2001 15:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

The formation of this compound, a\nregular 2 dimensional honeycomb ice lattice, occurs by a first order phase\ntransitions that involves the reorientation of water molecules. The model is\nanalyzed using new and simple effective cluster approach which highlights the\nrelevant transitions in system. This method is based on the cluster variation\nmethod used successfully in our previous work on the UPD of Cu onto Au(111),\nand permits us to explore a large region of parameter space, an essential\nfeature to study this complex system. The theory makes full use of the\nproperties of the diffuse layer: The water molecule is reoriented as the\npotential is changed. For positive potentials it forms linear chains which are\nresponsible for the $\\sqrt 3 \\times \\sqrt 7$ structure of the sulfate observed\nby STM. At negative potentials water turns so that its dipole points towards\nthe Pt. Then it will form a regular honeycomb network of hydrogen bonded\nmolecules, with the sulfate at the center of the hexagons. Then the bisulfate\nis desorbed, leaving the honeycomb HER structure behind. Our model thus\nprovides an explanation of the well known fact that only 2/3 of the Pt atoms\nparticipate in the electroreduction of the hydrogen.
