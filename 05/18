This so-called cold dark matter (CDM) crisis has\nbeen addressed in several ways, ranging from a change in fundamental physics by\nintroducing self-interacting cold dark matter particles to a tuning of complex\nastrophysical processes such as global and/or local feedback. All these efforts\nattempt to soften density profiles and reduce the abundance of satellites in\nsimulated galaxy halos. In this paper, we explore a somewhat different approach\nwhich consists of filtering the dark matter power spectrum on small scales,\nthereby altering the formation history of low mass objects. The physical\nmotivation for damping these fluctuations lies in the possibility that the dark\nmatter particles have a different nature i.e. are warm (WDM) rather than cold.\nWe show that this leads to some interesting new results in terms of the merger\nhistory and large-scale distribution of low mass halos, as compared to the\nstandard CDM scenario. However, WDM does not appear to be the ultimate\nsolution, in the sense that it is not able to fully solve the CDM crisis, even\nthough one of the main drawbacks, namely the abundance of satellites, can be\nremedied. Indeed, the cuspiness of the halo profiles still persists, at all\nredshifts, and for all halos and sub-halos that we investigated. Despite the\npersistence of the cuspiness problem of DM halos, WDM seems to be still worth\ntaking seriously, as it alleviates the problems of overabundant sub-structures\nin galactic halos and possibly the lack of angular momentum of simulated disk\ngalaxies. WDM also lessens the need to invoke strong feedback to solve these\nproblems, and may provide a natural explanation of the clustering properties\nand ages of dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2001 23:00:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2001 05:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We\ndemonstrate that the power Fourier transform (PFT) of the emission spectrum\nexhibits a certain peak-like structure, which also depends on the excitation\nspot. Our intriguing observation is that averaging the individual PFTs does not\nlead to a structureless curve, but rather yields a series of distinct transform\npeaks. This suggests universality, namely that the underlying random resonators\nthat are responsible for the laser emission from the pi-conjugated polymer film\nare almost identical. We argue that the reason for such an universality is the\nlarge size of a typical resonator, which we determined from the PFT, as\ncompared to the emission wavelength, lambda. This fact is, in turn, a\nconsequence of the large light mean free path, l* approximately 10 lambda in\nthe polymer film. This contrasts previous observations of random lasing in\npowders, where l* approx. lambda. We develop a simple theory that explains the\npresence of peaks in the average PFT and predicts their shape.

This approach is based on\nphenomenological laws of hadron production related to the spin, isospin,\nstrangeness content and mass of the particles. The ``effective'' numbers of s\nand \\bar{s} quarks in the isoscalar partners i_1 and i_2 are given by the\nnonstrange-strange mixing angle \\phi: k(i_1)=2\\sin^2\\phi and\nk(i_2)=2\\cos^2\\phi. From the total production rates per hadronic Z decay of all\nlight-flavour hadrons measured so far at LEP the values for k are found to be:\nk(\\eta) \\equiv 2-k(\\eta^{\\prime}) = 0.91 \\pm 0.12, k(\\phi) \\equiv 2-k(\\omega) =\n1.94 \\pm 0.09, k(f_2^{\\prime}) \\equiv 2-k(f_2) = 1.84 \\pm 0.21 and k(f_0) =\n0.09 \\pm 0.13. Our results on the \\eta--\\eta^{\\prime}, \\omega--\\phi and\nf_2--f_2^{\\prime} isoscalar mixing are consistent with the present experimental\nevidence. Quite remarkably, our value for k(\\eta) corresponds to the\nsinglet-octet mixing angle \\theta_P = -12.4^{\\circ} \\pm 3.5^{\\circ}. The\nobtained strangeness content of the f_0(980) scalar/isoscalar is not consistent\nwith the values supported by different model studies. However, taking the\nf_0(980) in our analysis with the mass of the bare state (K-matrix pole)\nf_0^{bare}(720 \\pm 100), the mixing angle is found to be: |\\phi_S^{bare}| =\n73^{\\circ} \\pm 7^{\\circ} \\pm 24^{\\circ}, in good agreement with the prediction\nof the K-matrix analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2001 12:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
