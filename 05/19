The radial number\ndensity profile is approximately exponential with a scale-length 1.3-1.5 kpc.\nHowever, there is an excess density at large radii that may be due to the tidal\neffect of the Milky Way.

This latter comet tail-shaped feature coexists with enhanced radio\nemission and is oriented nearly perpendicular to the major axis of the pulsar\nwind nebula. We propose the following scenario to explain these features. The\nbright, compact nebula is likely powered by a toroidal pulsar wind of\nrelativistic particles which is partially confined by the ram-pressure from the\nsupersonic motion of the pulsar. The particles, after being forced out from the\ncompact nebula (the head of the ``comet''), are eventually dumped into a bubble\n(the tail), which is primarily responsible for the extended diffuse X-ray and\nradio emission. The ram-pressure confinement also allows a natural explanation\nfor the observed X-ray luminosity of the compact nebula and for the unusually\nsmall X-ray to spin-down luminosity ratio, compared to similarly energetic\npulsars.

The motivation for this study is a recent\ncalculation [Peskin et al, J. Chem. Phys. 111, 7558 (1999)] that indicates that\nelectron tunneling through water may be enhanced by tunneling resonances in the\nrange of ~1eV below the vacuum barrier and finds that the lifetimes of such\nresonances are in the 10fs range, same order as OH stretch periods. Our\ncalculation is based on the absorbing-boundary-conditions-Green's-function\n(ABCGF) method. First we consider the effect of a single symmetric OH-stretch\nmode on electron tunneling in an otherwise frozen water environment and\nestablish that the inelastic tunneling probability is small enough to justify\nan approach based on perturbation theory limited to single phonon transitions.\nNext we note that on the short timescale of a tunneling event, even under\nresonance conditions, water nuclear dynamics may be represented in the\ninstantaneous normal modes picture. We generalize the ABCGF method to take into\naccount low order inelastic scattering from a continuum of such harmonic normal\nmodes. We find that near resonance the total inelastic transmission probability\nis of the same order as the elastic one, and may lead to an additional ~20-40%\nenhancement of the overall transmission in the range of up to 1eV below the\nvacuum barrier. The absolute energy exchange is small, of the order of 1% of\nthe incident electron energy. The main contribution to the inelastic\ntransmission is associated with energy transfer into the rotational-librational\nrange of the water instantaneous normal mode spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 May 2001 06:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We employ a light-cone formulation of the DY reaction in the rest\nframe of the nucleus, where the dimuons detected at small values of Bjorken x_2\n<< 1 may be considered to originate from the decay of a heavy photon radiated\nfrom an incident quark in a bremsstrahlung process. We infer the energy loss of\nthe quark by examining the suppression of the nuclear-dependent DY ratios seen\nas a function of projectile momentum fraction x_1 and dimuon mass M. Shadowing,\nwhich also leads to nuclear suppression of dimuons, is calculated within the\nsame approach employing the results of phenomenological fits to deep inelastic\nscattering data from HERA. The analysis yields -dE/dz =2.73 +/- 0.37 +/- 0.5\nGeV/fm for the rate of quark energy loss per unit path length, a value\nconsistent with theoretical expectations including the effects of the inelastic\ninteraction of the incident proton at the surface of the nucleus.
