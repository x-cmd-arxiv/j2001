In our\nmodel, the build-up of angular momentum is a random walk process associated\nwith the mass assembly history of the halo's major progenitor. We assume no\ncorrelation between the angular momenta of accreted objects. Using the extended\nPress-Schechter approximation, we calculate the growth of mass, angular\nmomentum, and spin parameter $\\lambda$ for many halos. Our random walk model\nreproduces the key features of the angular momentum of halos found in N-body\nsimulations: a lognormal distribution in $\\lambda$ with an average of\n$<\\lambda> \\approx 0.04$, independent of mass and redshift. The evolution of\nthe spin parameter in individual halos in this model is quite different from\nthe steady increase with time of angular momentum in the tidal torque picture.\nWe find both in N-body simulations and in our random walk model that the value\nof $\\lambda$ changes significantly with time for a halo's major progenitor. It\ntypically has a sharp increase due to major mergers, and a steady decline\nduring periods of gradual accretion of small satellites. The model predicts\nthat on average the $\\lambda$ of halos which had major mergers after redshift\n$z=2$ should be substantially larger than the $\\lambda$ of those which did not.\nPerhaps surprisingly, this suggests that halos that host late-forming\nelliptical galaxies should rotate faster than halos of spiral galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2001 05:59:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2002 15:34:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2002 00:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We investigate the significance of these hidden\ncorrelation representations within the so-called\n``creation-discovery-approach'' and in particular their compatibility with the\n``hidden measurement formalism''. This leads us to the introduction of the\nnotions of 'soft' and 'hard' 'acts of creation' and to the observation that our\napproach can be seen as a theory of (pseudo-)individuals when compared to the\nstandard quantum theory. (For a presentation of the ideas proposed in this\npaper within a quantum logical setting, yielding a structural theorem for the\nrepresentation of a compound quantum system in terms of the Hilbert space\ntensor product, we refer to quant-ph/0008054.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 May 2001 19:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

If the spin-S entity is in a maximal spin state,\nthe 2S individual spin-1/2 entities behave as a collection of indistinguishable\nbut separated entities. If not so, we have to introduce the same kind of hidden\ncorrelations as required for a hidden correlation representation of a compound\nquantum systems described by a symmetrical superposition. Moreover, by applying\nthe Majorana representation and Aerts' representation for a spin-1/2 entity,\nthis hidden correlation representation yields a classical mechanistic\nrepresentation of a spin-S entity in R^3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 May 2001 19:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 May 2001 21:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
