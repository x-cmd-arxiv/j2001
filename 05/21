In the liquid phase close to the\nideal glass transition line and in the glassy regime a medium range\norientational order occurs leading to a softening of an orientational mode. To\ninvestigate the role of this mode we use the molecular mode-coupling equations\nto calculate the spectra $\\phi_{lm}^{\\prime \\prime}(q,\\omega)$ and $\\chi\n_{lm}''(q,\\omega)$. In the center of mass spectra $ \\phi_{00}''(q,\\omega)$ and\n$\\chi_{00}''(q,\\omega)$ we found besides a high frequency peak at $\\omega\n_{hf}$ a peak at $\\omega_{op}$, about one decade below $\\omega_{hf}$. $\\omega\n_{op}$ has almost no $q$-dependence and exhibits an ``isotope'' effect $\\omega\n_{op}\\propto I^{-1/2}$, with $I$ the moment of inertia. We give evidence that\nthe existence of this peak is related to the occurrence of the medium ranged\norientational order. It is shown that some of these feature also exist for\nschematic mode coupling models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2001 08:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The main\npurpose is to estimate the theoretical uncertainties on the extraction of the\nneutron DIS structure function from such nuclear measurements. On one hand,\nwithin models in which no modification of the bound nucleon structure functions\nis taken into account, we have investigated the possible uncertainties arising\nfrom: i) charge symmetry breaking terms in the nucleon-nucleon interaction, ii)\nfinite Q**2 effects neglected in the Bjorken limit, iii) the role of different\nprescriptions for the nucleon Spectral Function normalization providing baryon\nnumber conservation, and iv) the differences between the virtual nucleon and\nlight cone formalisms. Although these effects have been not yet considered in\nexisting analyses, our conclusion is that all these effects cancel at the level\nof ~ 1% for x < 0.75 in overall agreement with previous findings. On the other\nhand we have considered several models in which the modification of the bound\nnucleon structure functions is accounted for to describe the EMC effect in DIS\nscattering from nuclei. It turns out that within these models the cancellation\nof nuclear effects is expected to occur only at a level of ~ 3%, leading to an\naccuracy of ~ 12 % in the extraction of the neutron to proton structure\nfunction ratio at x ~ 0.7 -0.8$.
