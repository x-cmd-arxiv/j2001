When the magnetic pressure approaches equipartition with the gas pressure,\nthe field begins to reconnect and the gas is heated up. The heated gas is\nbuoyant and moves outward, causing line stretching of the frozen-in magnetic\nfield. This leads to further reconnection, and more heating and\nbuoyancy-induced motions, so that the flow makes a transition to a state of\nself-sustained convection. The radial structure of the flow changes\ndramatically from its initial Bondi profile, and the mass accretion rate onto\nthe black hole decreases significantly. Motivated by the numerical results, we\ndevelop a simplified analytical model of a radiatively inefficient spherical\nflow in which convective transport of energy to large radii plays an important\nrole.

We\nconcentrate on the formation of large scale magnetic structures and outflows\nconnected with the Parker instability. For the sake of simplicity we show only\nmodels with a fixed explosion energy corresponding to a single SN occuring in\nhost galaxies with different fixed values of the gravitational acceleration $g$\nand different ratios of specific heats. We show that in general depending on\nthese two parameters, three different regimes are possible: a) a slowly growing\nParker instability on time scales much longer than the galac tic rotation\nperiod for small $g$, b) the Parker instability growing at roughly the rotation\nperiod, which for ratios of specific heats larger than 1 is accompanied byan\noutflow resulting from the explosion for intermediate $g$, and c) a rapidly g\nrowing instability and a strong blowout flow for large $g$. By means of\nnumerical simul ations and analytical estimates we show that the explosion\nenergy and gravitational acceleration which separate the three regimes scale as\n$Eg^2\\sim $const in the 2D case. We expect that in the 3D case this scaling law\nis $Eg^3\\sim $const. Our simulations demonstrate furthermore, that a single SN\nexplosion can lead to the growth of multiple Parker loops in the disc and large\nscale magnetic field loops in the halo, extending over 2-3 kpc horizontally and\nup to 3 kpc vertically abov e the midplane of the disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2001 11:07:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2001 16:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

As a result, the LDOS at the core exhibits a double-peak\nstructure near the Fermi level that is in good agreement with the STM\nobservations on YBCO and BSCCO. The presence of local AF order near the votex\ncore is also consistent with the recent neutron scattering experiment on LSCO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2001 23:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is possible to eliminate all unphysical and geometric quantities\nestablishing a non-local and non-polynomial action depending solely on the\nscalar field and on some integration constants, fixed by suitable boundary\nconditions on the asymptotic effective line element.\n  Then, attention is turned to the evaluation of the (two) lowest order tree\nvertices, explicitly assuming a perturbative expansion in the scalar field\nbeing valid. Each of them diverges, but unexpected cancellations yield a finite\nS-matrix element when both contributions are summed. The phenomenon of a\n\"virtual black hole\" -- already encountered in the simpler case of minimally\ncoupled scalars in two dimensions -- occurs, as the study of the (matter\ndependent) metric reveals. A discussion of the scattering amplitude leads to\nthe prediction of gravitational decay of spherical waves, a novel physical\nphenomenon. Several possible extensions conclude this dissertation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2001 18:56:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2001 15:49:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2001 09:21:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 20 May 2003 14:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Although most of our discussion refers to arbitrary p-branes, when\nwe need to be specific we assume that they are D-branes of Type II or Type I\nstring theory. For realistic brane couplings, such as those arising in string\ntheory, the inter-brane potentials are too steep to inflate the universe for\nacceptably long times.

The contributions to\nthe energy per particle $\\bar E(k_f)$ from one- and two-pion exchange diagrams\nare ordered in powers of the Fermi momentum $k_f$ (modulo functions of $k_f\n/m_\\pi$). It is demonstrated that, already at order ${\\cal O}(k_f^4)$, two-pion\nexchange produces realistic nuclear binding. The underlying saturation\nmechanism is surprisingly simple (in the chiral limit), namely the combination\nof an attractive $k_f^3$-term and a repulsive $k_f^4$-term. The empirical\nsaturation point and the nuclear compressibility $K\\simeq 250 $MeV are well\nreproduced at order ${\\cal O}(k_f^5)$ with a momentum cut-off of $\\Lambda\n\\simeq 0.65$ GeV which parametrizes short-range dynamics. No further\nshort-distance terms are required in our calculation of nuclear matter. In the\nsame framework we calculate the density-dependent asymmetry energy and find\n$A_0\\simeq 34 $MeV at the saturation point, in good agreement with the\nempirical value. The pure neutron matter equation of state is also in fair\nqualitative agreement with sophisticated many-body calculations and a\nresummation result of effective field theory, but only for low neutron\ndensities $\\rho_n <0.25 $fm$^{-3}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2001 12:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The cyclic universe goes through the six\ntransitions: the triplet universe, the inflation, the big bang, the\nquintessence, the big crush, and the deflation transitions. The universe starts\nwith eleven dimensional space-time with two boundary 9-branes separated by a\nfinite gap spanning an intervening bulk volume. The triplet transition starts\nwhen the bulk 9-brane is generated from the hidden boundary 9-brane, and\ncollides with the pre-observable 9-brane. The collision starts the inflation\ntransition. The collision is the brane dimensional interference mixing between\nthe pre-observable 9-brane and the bulk 9-brane. The results are the mixed\nbranes (combined brane dimensions), the internal space (cancelled brane\ndimensions), the bulk space, 3-brane vacuum, and cosmic radiation. Cosmic\nradiation generated during the inflation leads to the big bang. Meanwhile, the\nhidden brane undergoes stepwise fractionalization, changing in stepwise manner\nfrom 9-brane to 3-brane. The observable universe expands in a constant rate\nuntil the quintessence transition. Afterward, there are the big crush\ntransition (the reverse of the big bang) and the deflation (the reverse of the\ninflation). The cosmic cycle of the fractionalization and condensation starts\nover again.
