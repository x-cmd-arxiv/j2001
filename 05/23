We compare the detailed predictions of models of the surface\nemission from a magnetar to the observed properties of AXPs. In particular, we\nfocus on the combination of their luminosities and energy-dependent pulsed\nfractions. We use the results of recent calculations for strongly magnetized\natmospheres to obtain the angle- and energy-dependence of the surface emission.\nWe include in our calculations the effects of general relativistic photon\ntransport and interstellar extinction. We find that the combination of the\nlarge pulsed fractions and the high luminosities of AXPs cannot be accounted\nfor by surface emission from a magnetar with two antipodal hot regions or a\ntemperature distribution characteristic of a magnetic dipole. This result is\nrobust for reasonable neutron star radii, for the range of magnetic field\nstrengths inferred from the observed spin down rates, and for surface\ntemperatures consistent with the spectral properties of AXPs. Models with a\nsingle hot emitting region can reproduce the observations, provided that the\ndistance to one of the sources is ~30% less than the current best estimate, and\nallowing for systematic uncertainties in the spectral fit of a second source.\nFinally, the thermal emission models with antipodal emission geometry predict a\ncharacteristic strong increase of the pulsed fraction with photon energy, which\nis apparently inconsistent with the current data. The energy-dependence of the\npulsed fraction in the models with one hot region shows a wider range of\nbehavior and can be consistent with the existing data.

Deep images also obtained\nwith the VLT in the B and I bands show that five of the seven galaxies have\nvery faint continuum fluxes (I(AB) approx. 26.8 and B(AB) approx. 27.3). The\nstar formation rates of these seven galaxies estimated from the rest-frame UV\ncontinuum around 2000AA, as probed by the I-band detections, as well as from\nthe Ly-alpha luminosities, are 1-4 M_sun yr^{-1}. This is 1-3 orders of\nmagnitude lower than for other known populations of star-forming galaxies at\nsimilar redshifts (the Lyman-Break galaxies and the sub-mm selected sources).\nThe inferred density of the objects is high, 16+-4 per arcmin^2 per unit\nredshift. This is consistent with the integrated luminosity function for\nLyman-Break galaxies down to R=27 if the fraction of Ly-alpha emitting galaxies\nis approx. 70% at the faint end of the luminosity function. However, if this\nfraction is 20% as reported for the bright end of the luminosity function then\nthe space density in this field is significantly larger (by a factor of 3.5)\nthan expected from the luminosity function for Lyman-Break galaxies in the\nHDF-North. This would be an indication that at least some radio quiet QSOs at\nhigh redshift reside in overdense environments or that the faint end slope of\nthe high redshift luminosity function has been underestimated. These\nobservations show that Ly-alpha emission is an efficient method by which to\nprobe the faint end of the luminosity function at high redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2001 04:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

This allows to find\nquasi-Shanmugadhasan canonical transformation to the class of 3-orthogonal\ngauges and to find the Dirac observables for superspace in these gauges.\n  The construction of the explicit form of the transformation and of the\nsolution of the rotation and supermomentum constraints is reduced to solve a\nsystem of elliptic linear and quasi-linear partial differential equations. We\nthen show that the superhamiltonian constraint becomes the Lichnerowicz\nequation for the conformal factor of the 3-metric and that the last gauge\nvariable is the momentum conjugated to the conformal factor. The gauge\ntransformations generated by the superhamiltonian constraint perform the\ntransitions among the allowed foliations of spacetime, so that the theory is\nindependent from its 3+1 splittings. In the special 3-orthogonal gauge defined\nby the vanishing of the conformal factor momentum we determine the final Dirac\nobservables for the gravitational field even if we are not able to solve the\nLichnerowicz equation. The final Hamiltonian is the weak ADM energy restricted\nto this completely fixed gauge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2001 14:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

The nonfactorizable effects, such as vertex-type and penguin-type\ncorrections to the two-body b decay and hard spectator corrections to the\n3-body decay are calculable in the heavy quark limit. QCD factorization is\napplicable when the emitted meson is a light meson or a charmonium. We discuss\nthe issue of the CPT constraint on partial rate asymmetries. The strong phase\ncoming from final-state rescattering due to hard gluon exchange between the\nfinal states can induce large rate asymmetries for tree-dominated\ncolor-suppressed modes $(\\pi^0,\\rho^0,\\omega)X_{\\bar s}$.

The approach exploits the\nnon-commutative structure of D-branes, so the space is described by an\nalgebraic geometry of non-commutative rings. The paper is devoted to the study\nof examples of these algebras. In our study there is an auxiliary commutative\nalgebraic geometry of the center of the (local) algebras which plays an\nimportant role as the target space geometry where closed strings propagate. The\nsingularities that are resolved will be the singularities of this auxiliary\ngeometry. The singularities are resolved by the non-commutative algebra if the\nlocal non-commutative rings are regular. This definition guarantees that\nD-branes have a well defined K-theory class. Homological functors also play an\nimportant role. They describe the intersection theory of D-branes and lead to a\nformal definition of local quivers at singularities, which can be computed\nexplicitly for many types of singularities. These results can be interpreted in\nterms of the derived category of coherent sheaves over the non-commutative\nrings, giving a non-commutative version of recent work by M. Douglas.

To keep the\nsize of this contribution small enough, most of our discussion will be limited\nto the cases of diagrams E6 and E6^{(1)}, i.e. to the quantum and classical\ntetrahedra. We shall in particular interpret the A11 labelling of the vertices\nof E6 diagram as a quantum analogue of the usual decomposition of spaces of\nsections for vector bundles above homogeneous spaces. We also show how to\nrecover Klein invariants of polyhedra by paths algebra techniques and discuss\ntheir quantum generalizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2001 15:52:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2001 21:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Instantons, in combination\nwith the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, are shown to provide the\nmajor mechanism for the ideal mixing between pseudoscalar strange and\nnon-strange quarkonia. As long as 't Hooft's interaction captures most of the\nbasic features of the axial QCD gluon anomaly, we identify the anomaly as the\nmain culprit for the appearance of octet flavor symmetry in the anomalous\nsectors of the pseudoscalar (and axial vector) mesons. Within this context,\nunitary spin is shown to be an accidental symmetry due to anomalous gluon\ndynamics rather than a fundamental symmetry in its own right. Though we find\nthe eta-nucleon coupling constant to obey a Goldberger-Treiman like relation,\nthe latter does not take its origin from a pole dominance of the induced\npseudoscalar form factor of the octet axial current, but from a subtle\nflavor-mixing mechanism that is traced back to instanton dynamics. The model\npresented allows for possible generalizations to non-ideal mixing angles and\ndifferent values of the meson decay constants in the strange and non-strange\nsectors, respectively. Finally, we discuss the issue as to what extent the eta\nmeson may be considered as a Goldstone boson under the constraints of the\nanomaly-produced unitary spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2001 18:11:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2001 18:13:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
