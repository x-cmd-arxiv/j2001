In the same state, the intensity of the power-law\ncomponent correlates negatively with that of the disk component, and positively\nwith the power-law photon index, suggesting that the strong power-law is simply\nthe missing optically thick disk emission. One possible explanation for this\nbehavior is inverse-Compton scattering in the disk. By re-fitting the same data\nincorporating a disk Comptonization, the inner radius and temperature of the\nunderlying disk are found to become more constant. These results provide one of\nthe first observational confirmations of the scenario of disk Comptonization in\nthe strong power-law state. This strong power-law state seems to appear when\ncolor temperature of the disk exceeds the certain threshold, 1.2 -- 1.3 keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2001 02:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We present results of a\nsmall survey of the J=1--0 line of {12}CO with the 15m SEST telescope on a\nsample of 11 accretors (10 counterrotators and 1 polar ring). The SEST sample\nis enlarged with published data from 48 galaxies, for which observational\nevidence of counterrotation in the gas and/or the stars has been found.\nFurthermore, the available data on a sample of 46 polar ring galaxies has been\ncompiled. It was found that the normalized content of cold gas (M_gas/L_B) in\npolar rings is ~1 order of magnitude higher than the reference value derived\nfor normal galaxies. The inferred gas masses are sufficient to stabilize polar\nrings through self-gravity. In contrast, it was found that the cold gas content\nof counterrotators is close to normal for all galaxy types. Although\ncounterrotators and polar rings probably share a common origin, the gas masses\nestimated here confirm that light gas rings accreted by future counterrotators\nmay have evolved faster than the self-gravitating structures of polar rings. In\nthis scenario, the transformation of atomic into molecular gas could be\nenhanced near the transition region between the prograde and the retrograde\ndisks, especially in late-type accretors characterized by a high content of\nprimordial gas. This is tentatively confirmed in this work: the measured H_2/HI\nratio seems larger in counterrotators than in normal or polar ring galaxies for\ntypes later than S0s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2001 08:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Near the crust bottom such waves reduce to a collisionless zero\nsound in an electron liquid, while near the stellar surface they behave as\nelectromagnetic waves in a medium. The magnetosonic waves propagate across the\ncrust and transform into electromagnetic radiation at the surface.

Nonetheless, such architecture\nsuffers from multicast state scalability problems with the growth in number of\nmobile nodes. This architecture also requires ubiquitous multicast deployment\nand more complex security measures. To alleviate these problems, we propose an\nintra-domain multicast-based mobility solution.

The results offer insights\ninto the effectiveness of evaporative cooling and the properties of molecular\nBose- Einstein condensates, as well as estimates of collisional lifetimes in\nmagnetic traps. Specifically, $^{17}O_{2}$ looks like a good candidate for\nultracold studies, while $^{16}O_{2}$ is unlikely to survive evaporative\ncooling. Since $^{17}O_{2}$ is representative of a wide class of molecules that\nare paramagnetic in their ground state we conclude that many molecules can be\nsuccessfully magnetically trapped at ultralow temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2001 22:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The most interesting case for Monte Carlo and quantum\nintegration is that of moderate smoothness k and large dimension d which, in\nfact, occurs in a number of important applied problems. In that case the\ndeterministic exponent is negligible, so the n^{-1/2} Monte Carlo and the\nn^{-1} quantum speedup essentially constitute the entire convergence rate.

We demonstrate clearly the advantage of classical post-processing\nwith two-way classical communications over classical post-processing with only\none-way classical communications in QKD. This is done by the explicit\nconstruction of a new protocol for (the error correction/detection and privacy\namplification of) BB84 that can tolerate a bit error rate of up to 18.9%, which\nis higher than what any BB84 scheme with only one-way classical communications\ncan possibly tolerate. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantage of the six-state\nscheme over BB84 by showing that the six-state scheme can strictly tolerate a\nhigher bit error rate than BB84. In particular, our six-state protocol can\ntolerate a bit error rate of 26.4%, which is higher than the upper bound of 25%\nbit error rate for any secure BB84 protocol.
