In this theory, the width of the neutral pion\ndecay into two photons is not proportional to (N_c)^2. In fact, in the case of\na single generation and hence for two quark flavors (N_f = 2), N_c does not\nappear explicitly in the low-energy effective theory of the standard model.\nHence, contrary to common lore, it is impossible to see the number of colors in\nlow-energy experiments with just pions and photons. For N_f > 2, on the other\nhand, N_c explicitly enters the chiral Lagrangian as the quantized prefactor of\nthe Wess-Zumino-Witten term, but the contribution of this term to photon-pion\nvertices is completely canceled by the N_c-dependent part of a\nGoldstone-Wilczek term. However, the width of the eta decay into pi^+ pi^-\ngamma survives the cancellation and is indeed proportional to (N_c)^2.

The cluster decomposition of the deuteron wave function at\nsmall binding only allows the nuclear coherent process to proceed if each\nnucleon absorbs an equal fraction of the overall momentum transfer.\nFurthermore, each nucleon must scatter while remaining close to its mass shell.\nThus the nuclear photoproduction amplitude, M_{gamma D -> pi^0 D}(u,t),\nfactorizes as a product of three factors: (1) the nucleon photoproduction\namplitude, M_{gamma N_1 -> pi^0 N_1}(u/4,t/4), at half of the overall momentum\ntransfer, (2) a nucleon form factor, F_{N_2}(t/4), at half the overall momentum\ntransfer, and (3) the reduced deuteron form factor, f_d(t), which according to\nperturbative QCD, has the same monopole falloff as a meson form factor.

The model has a realistic set of predator-prey\nequations that describe the population dynamics of the species for any\nstructure of the food web. The equations account for competition between\nspecies for the same resources, and for the diet choice of predators between\nalternative prey according to an evolutionarily stable strategy. The set of\nspecies present undergoes long-term evolution due to speciation and extinction\nevents. We summarize results obtained on the macro-evolutionary dynamics of\nspeciations and extinctions, and on the statistical properties of the food webs\nthat are generated by the model. Simulations begin from small numbers of\nspecies and build up to larger webs with relatively constant species number on\naverage. The rate of origination and extinction of species are relatively high,\nbut remain roughly balanced throughout the simulations. When a `parent' species\nundergoes speciation, the `child' species usually adds to the same trophic\nlevel as the parent. The chance of the child species surviving is significantly\nhigher if the parent is on the second or third trophic level than if it is on\nthe first level, most likely due to a wider choice of possible prey for species\non higher levels. Addition of a new species sometimes causes extinction of\nexisting species. The parent species has a high probability of extinction\nbecause it has strong competition with the new species. Non-parental\ncompetitors of the new species also have a significantly higher extinction\nprobability than average, as do prey of the new species.

We\nshow that the presence of these two effects leads to the major part of the\nquantum mechanical structure of a theory where the measurements contain the two\nmentioned effects. We present a quantum machine, where we can illustrate in a\nsimple way how the quantum structure arises as a consequence of the two\neffects. We introduce a parameter 'epsilon' that measures the amount of the\nlack of knowledge on the measurement process, and by varying this parameter, we\ndescribe a continuous evolution from a quantum structure (maximal lack of\nknowledge) to a classical structure (zero lack of knowledge). We show that for\nintermediate values of epsilon we find a new type of structure that is neither\nquantum nor classical. We analyze the quantum paradoxes and show that they can\nbe divided into two groups: (1) The group (measurement problem and Schrodingers\ncat paradox) where the paradoxical aspects arise mainly from the application of\nstandard quantum theory as a general theory (e.g. also describing the\nmeasurement apparatus). This type of paradox disappears in the hidden\nmeasurement formalism. (2) A second group collecting the paradoxes connected to\nthe effect of non-locality (the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and the\nviolation of Bell inequalities). We show that these paradoxes are internally\nresolved because the effect of non-locality turns out to be a fundamental\nproperty of the hidden measurement formalism itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2001 20:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This leads to\nenvironment-induced superselection or einselection, a quantum process\nassociated with selective loss of information. Einselected pointer states are\nstable. They can retain correlations with the rest of the Universe in spite of\nthe environment. Einselection enforces classicality by imposing an effective\nban on the vast majority of the Hilbert space, eliminating especially the\nflagrantly non-local \"Schr\\\"odinger cat\" states. Classical structure of phase\nspace emerges from the quantum Hilbert space in the appropriate macroscopic\nlimit: Combination of einselection with dynamics leads to the idealizations of\na point and of a classical trajectory.
