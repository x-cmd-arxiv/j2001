We found the following: 1) The slope of the stellar initial mass\nfunction (IMF) for 6.3--18 Msolar stars formed in the starburst lies between\ntwo limiting cases: a value of -1.9+/-0.4 under the assumption of coevality\nover the past 13 Myr and of -0.9+/-0.3 under the assumption of constant star\nformation over the past 40 Myr. Thus, most likely, the IMF of the intermediate\nmass stars is not very unusual. The slope of the IMF for the underlying galaxy\npopulation under the assumption of constant star formation is -2.6+/-0.3 for\n4.8-18 Msolar stars. 2) The lower stellar mass limit in the starburst is <6.3\nMsolar. This constraint is less than some predictions of what lower stellar\nmass limits might be in starbursts, but higher than others. 3) There are two\nmodest-sized Halpha shells that could easily have been produced in the past few\nMyr by the clusters they encircle. 4) The dominant mode of star formation in\nthe starburst has been that of a scaled-up OB association. This mode, with a\nfew compact clusters sprinkled in, is similar to the star formation that took\nplace in Constellation III in the LMC, as well as that in the Blue Compact\nDwarfs IZw18 and VIIZw403.

With the\naim of distinguishing among different theoretical explanations for the glitch\nphenomenon, we study the response of a neutron star to two types of\nperturbations to the vortex array that exists in the superfluid interior: 1)\nthermal motion of vortices pinned to inner crust nuclei, initiated by sudden\nheating of the crust, (e.g., a starquake), and 2) mechanical motion of\nvortices, (e.g., from crust cracking by superfluid stresses). Both mechanisms\nproduce acceptable fits to glitch observations in four pulsars, with the\nexception of the 1989 glitch in the Crab pulsar, which is best fit by the\nthermal excitation model. The two models make different predictions for the\ngeneration of internal heat and subsequent enhancement of surface emission. The\nmechanical glitch model predicts a negligible temperature increase. For a pure\nand highly-conductive crust, the thermal glitch model predicts a surface\ntemperature increase of as much as $\\sim$ 2%, occurring several weeks after the\nglitch.

The approach makes use of a pseudo-particle representation of\nthe impurity Hilbert space in the limit of infinite Coulomb repulsion $U$ as\nwell as for finite $U$. Approximations are derived from a generating\nLuttinger-Ward functional, in terms of renormalized perturbation theory in the\nhybridization $V$. Within a ``conserving T-matrix approximation'' (CTMA),\nincluding all two-particle vertex functions, an infinite series of leading\ninfrared singular skeleton diagrams is included. The local constraint is\nstrictly enforced. Applied to the SU(N) $\\times$ SU(M) multichannel Anderson\nmodel the method allows to recover the Fermi liquid behavior of the single\nchannel case, as well as the non-Fermi liquid behavior in the multi-channel\ncase. The results are compared with the ``non-crossing approximation'' (NCA)\nand with data obtained by the numerical renormalization group and the Bethe\nansatz. The generalization of the method to the case of finite on-site\nrepulsion $U$ is presented in a systematical way and solved on the level of a\ngeneralized NCA, fully symmetric with respect to all virtual excitations of the\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2001 17:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
