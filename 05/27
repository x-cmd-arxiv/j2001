Because the direct evidence for BHs should\ncome from determination of strong gravitational redshift, we hope an object can\nfall into the region near the BH horizon where radiation can be detected.\nTherefore the object must be compact stars as neutron stars(NSs), then the\nintense astrophysical processes will release very high energy radiation which\nis transient, fast-variant. These phenomena may point to gamma-ray bursts(GRBs)\nobserved. And recent observations of iron lines suggest that afterglows of GRBs\nshow the similar property in active galatic nuclei(AGNs), implying GRBs may\noriginate from intense events related to black holes. In this letter, a model\nfor GRBs and afterglows is proposed to obtain the range of gravitational\nredshifts($z_g$) of GRBs with known cosmological redshifts.

The interaction lines in the Feynman diagrams\nare dynamically screened by the charge fluctuations in the system. Although the\nformal expansion is exact-assuming that the model under the study is\nperturbative-only if diagrams to all orders are included, it is shown that for\nlarge-on-site-Coulomb-repulsion-U systems weak-coupling expansions to a few\norders may already converge. We show that the screened interaction for the\nlarge-U system can be vanishingly small at a certain intermediate electron\nfilling; and it is found that our approximation for the imaginary part of the\none-particle self energy agrees well with the QMC results in the low energy\nscales at this particular filling. But, the usefulness of the approximation is\nhindered by the fact that it has the incorrect filling dependence when the\nfilling deviates from this value. We also calculate the exact QMC Fermi\nsurfaces for the two-dimensional (2-D) Hubbard model for several fillings. Our\nresults near half filling show extreme violation of the concepts of the band\ntheory; in fact, instead of growing, Fermi surface vanishes when doped toward\nthe half-filled Mott-Hubbard insulator. Sufficiently away from half filling,\nnoninteracting-like Fermi surfaces are recovered. These results combined with\nthe Luttinger theorem might show that diagrammatic expansions for the\nnearly-half-filled Hubbard model are unlikely to be possible; however, the\nnonperturbative part of the solution seems to be less important as the filling\ngradually moves away from one half.

By comparing far-field intensity patterns with images of the\nmicro-laser we find that the lasing modes are concentrated on three-bounce\nunstable periodic ray orbits, i.e. the modes are scarred. The high-intensity\nemission directions of these scarred modes are completely different from those\npredicted by applying Snell's law to the ray orbit. This effect is due to the\nprocess of ``Fresnel filtering'' which occurs when a beam of finite angular\nspread is incident at the critical angle for total internal reflection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2001 22:13:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2001 21:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
