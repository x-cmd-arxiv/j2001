Peculiar velocities (PVs) yield a tight and\nunique constraint on cosmological characteristics, independent of Lambda and\nbiasing, such as the cosmological matter density parameter Omega_m and the\nconvergence of bulk flows on large scales. Significant progress towards\nincorporating non-linear dynamics and improvements of velocity field\nreconstruction techniques have led to a rigorous control of errors and much\nrefined cosmic flow analyses. Current investigations favor low-amplitude (< 250\nkm/s) bulk flows on the largest scales (< ~100 Mpc/h) probed reliably by\nexisting redshift-distance surveys, consistent with favored LambdaCDM\ncosmogonies. Tidal field analyses also suggest that the Shapley Concentration,\nlocated behind the Great Attractor (GA), might play an important dynamical\nrole, even at the Local Group.

We concentrate our attention on the role of the\nradiation force by a starburst as well as an AGN, where the effects of optical\ndepth of dusty gas are taken into consideration. In two-dimensional\naxisymmetric space, we analyze the configuration and the stability of\ngeometrically thin walls which are in balance between radiation pressure and\ngravity. As a result, it is shown that the radiation force by the circumnuclear\nstarburst works to stabilize optically thick walls surrounding the nucleus. In\nthe case of a brighter starburst with a fainter AGN, there form double walls,\nan inner one of which is located between the nucleus and the circumnuclear\nstarburst, and an outer one of which enshrouds both the starburst regions and\nthe nucleus. The total extinction (Av) of both walls turns out to be ~10 for a\nbrighter starburst. As a consequence, double walls could heavily obscure the\nnucleus to make the AGN type 2. The outer wall may provide an explanation for\nthe recent indications for large-scale obscuring materials in Seyfert 2's.\nAlso, it is predicted that the AGN type is shifts from type 2 to type 1 in\nseveral times 10^7 yr according to the stellar evolution in the starburst. In\ncontrast, if the AGN itself is much brighter than the starburst as a quasar is,\nthen neither wall forms regardless of the starburst activity and the nucleus is\nlikely to be identified as type 1. To conclude, the radiatively-supported gas\nwalls could be responsible for the putative correlation between AGN type and\nthe starbursts, whereby Seyfert 2 galaxies are more frequently associated with\ncircumnuclear starbursts than type 1, whereas quasars are mostly observed as\ntype 1 regardless of star-forming activity in the host galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2001 12:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

An amorphous rubbery polymer\nis treated as a network of long chains linked by permanent junctions (chemical\ncrosslinks, entanglements and filler particles). A strand between two\nneighboring junctions is thought of as a sequence of mers whose motion is\nrestricted to some tube by surrounding macromolecules. Unlike the conventional\napproach that presumes the cross-section of the tube to be constant, we\npostulate that its radius strongly depends on the longitudinal coordinate. This\nimplies that a strand may be modeled as a sequence of segments whose thermal\nmotion is totally frozen by the environment (bottle-neck points of the tube)\nbridged by threads of mers which go through all possible configurations during\nthe characteristic time of a test. Thermal fluctuations affect the tube's\nradius, which results in freezing and activation of regions with high molecular\nmobility (RHMs). The viscoelastic response of an elastomer is associated with\nthermally activated changes in the number of RHMs in strands. Stress-strain\nrelations for a rubbery polymer at finite strains and kinetic equations for the\nconcentrations of RHMs are developed by using the laws of thermodynamics. At\nsmall strains these relations are reduced to the conventional integral\nconstitutive equation in linear viscoelasticity with a novel scaling law for\nrelaxation times.
