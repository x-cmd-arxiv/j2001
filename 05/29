With the\nphotometric metallicity (FeH=0.144pm0.013 dex, Grenon (2000) we derive\nY=0.255\\pm0.009. Because of the (Y,FeH) degeneracy in the M-L plane, the\nuncertainty grows to Delta Y=0.013 if the metallicity from spectroscopy is\nadopted (FeH=0.14pm0.05 dex, Cayrel de Strobel et al 1997).

In the low mass region of the HR diagram sensitive to the\nmixing-length parameter (aMLT), the slope of the main sequence (MS) suggests\nthat aMLT could decrease from a solar (or even supersolar) value at higher mass\nto subsolar values at low mass, which is also supported by the modeling of the\nvB22 M-L relation.

Initially used for solving the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, quantum\nalgebras have subsequently found applications in several branches of physics,\nas, for example, in the description of spin chains, squeezed states, hydrogen\natom and hydrogen-like spectra, rotational and vibrational nuclear and\nmolecular spectra, and in conformal field theories. By now much work has been\ndone on the q-deformed oscillator and its relativistic extensions, and several\nkinds of generalized deformed oscillators and SU(2) algebras have been\nintroduced. Here we shall confine ourselves to a list of applications of\nquantum algebras in nuclear structure physics and in molecular physics and, in\naddition, a recent application of quantum algebraic techniques to the structure\nof atomic clusters will be discussed in more detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2001 08:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
