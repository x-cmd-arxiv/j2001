The phase lags and coherence measures are used\nto distinguish three types of low-frequency QPOs (one more than those reported\nby Wijnands, Homan, & van der Klis 1999). For the most common type, the phase\nlag is correlated with both the QPO frequency and the amplitude.

We look for the\norbital magnetism of the electrons in different regimes of temperature $T$,\nmagnetic field $\\vec B$ and noncommutative parameter $\\te$. We prove that the\ndegeneracy of Landau levels can be lifted by the $\\te$-term appearing in the\nelectron energy spectrum at weak magnetic field. Using the {\\it Berezin-Lieb}\ninequalities for thermodynamical potential, it is shown that in the high\ntemperature limit, the system exibits a magnetic $\\te$-dependent behaviour,\nwhich is missing in the commutative case. Moreover, a correction to\nsusceptibility at low $T$ is observed. Using the {\\it Fermi-Dirac} trace\nformulas, a generalization of the thermodynamical potential, the average number\nof electrons and the magnetization is obtained. There is a critical point where\nthe thermodynamical potential becomes infinite in both of two methods above. So\nat this point we deal with the partition function by adopting another approach.\nThe standard results in the commutative case for this model can be recovered by\nswitching off the $\\te$-parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2001 10:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2001 07:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

However, test filtering is costly to perform in large-eddy\nsimulation of complex geometry flows, especially on unstructured grids. The\nobjective of this work is to develop and test an approximate but less costly\ndynamic procedure which does not require test filtering. The proposed method is\nbased on Taylor series expansions of the resolved velocity fields. Accuracy is\ngoverned by the derivative schemes used in the calculation and the number of\nterms considered in the approximation to the test filtering operator. The\nexpansion is developed up to fourth order, and results are tested a priori\nbased on direct numerical simulation data of forced isotropic turbulence in the\ncontext of the dynamic Smagorinsky model. The tests compare the dynamic\nSmagorinsky coefficient obtained from filtering with those obtained from\napplication of the Taylor series expansion. They show that the expansion up to\nsecond order provides a reasonable approximation to the true dynamic\ncoefficient (with errors on the order of about 5 % for c_s^2), but that\nincluding higher-order terms does not necessarily lead to improvements in the\nresults due to inherent limitations in accurately evaluating high-order\nderivatives. A posteriori tests using the Taylor series approximation in LES of\nforced isotropic turbulence and channel flow confirm that the Taylor series\napproximation yields accurate results for the dynamic coefficient.
