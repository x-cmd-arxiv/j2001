Both in early-type and late-type\nSeyferts, the presence of recent star-formation is related to the galaxy\nmorphology in the inner few kiloparsecs, as observed in HST images through the\nfilter F606W by Malkan et al., who has assigned a late ``inner Hubble type'' to\nmost Seyfert 2s with recent nuclear star-formation.

The replenished charges partially screen the\nelectric field, which is self-consistently solved, together with the\ndistribution functions of particles and gamma-rays.

We analyze in detail the excitation of the CN lines and find\nthat the hyperfine ratios of the N=3-2 line are always close to the Local\nThermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) optically thin values even in the case of\noptically thick emission. This is due to different excitation temperatures for\nthe different hyperfine lines.

The metric is allowed to have explicit dependence on the \"extra\"\ncoordinate(s). This is the usual scenario in brane-world and space-time-matter\ntheories. We extend the usual discussion by considering five-dimensional\nmetrics with off-diagonal terms. We replace the condition of cylindricity by\nthe requirement that physics in four-dimensional space-time should remain\ninvariant under changes of coordinates in the five-dimensional bulk. This\ninvariance does not eliminate physical effects from the extra dimension but\nseparates them from spurious geometrical ones. We use the appropriate splitting\ntechnique to construct the most general induced energy-momentum tensor,\ncompatible with the required invariance. It generalizes all previous results in\nthe literature. In addition, we find two four-vectors, J_{m}^{mu} and\nJ_{e}^{mu}, induced by off-diagonal metrics, that separately satisfy the usual\nequation of continuity in 4D. These vectors appear as source-terms in equations\nthat closely resemble the ones of electromagnetism.

We explicitly derive two possible semiclassical\nformulae for the propagator, we suggest a third one, and we discuss their\nrelationships. We also derive an initial value representation for the\nsemiclassical propagator, based on an initial gaussian wavepacket. It turns out\nto be related to, but different from, Heller's thawed gaussian approximation.\nIt is very different from the Herman--Kluk formula, which is not a correct\nsemiclassical limit. We point out errors in two derivations of the latter.\nFinally we show how the semiclassical coherent state propagators lead to\nWKB-type quantization rules and to approximations for the Husimi distributions\nof stationary states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2001 13:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
