The results show that the energy in the CIB from far\ninfrared to millimeter wavelengths is comparable to that in the integrated\nlight of galaxies from UV to near infrared wavelengths: the universe had a\nluminous but dusty past. On the assumption that nucleosynthesis in stars is the\nenergy source for most of this light, the results also imply that 1 to 8\npercent of cosmic baryons has been converted to helium and heavier elements in\nstars.

The results are combined with the bar\ntorques for 30 other galaxies determined from our previous $K$-band survey\n(Buta & Block 2001). Relative bar torques determine the degree of spiral arm\nforcing, gas accretion, and bar evolution. They differ from other measures of\nbar strength, such as the relative amplitude of the bar determined\nphotometrically, because they include the bulge and other disk light that\ncontributes to the radial component of the total force. If the bulge is strong\nand the radial forcing large, then even a prominent bar can have a relatively\nweak influence on the azimuthal motions in the disk. Here we find that the\nrelative bar torque correlates only weakly with the optical bar type listed in\nthe Revised Shapley-Ames and de Vaucouleurs systems. In fact, some classically\nbarred galaxies have weaker relative bar torques than classically unbarred\ngalaxies. The optical class is a poor measure of azimuthal disk forcing for two\nreasons: some infrared bars are not seen optically, and some bars with strong\nbulges have their azimuthal forces so strongly diluted by the average radial\nforce that they exert only small torques on their disks. The Hubble\nclassification scheme poorly recognizes the gravitational influence of bars.\nApplications of our bar torque method to the high-redshift universe are briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2001 13:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The possibility to\ngain information on the neutron charge form factor from an analysis of $A(Q^2)$\nhas been investigated.

Self-similarity or scale invariance implies long-range\nspatiotemporal correlations and is manifested in atmospheric flows as the\nfractal geometry to spatial pattern concomitant with inverse power-law form for\npower spectra of temporal fluctuations. Long-range spatiotemporal correlations\nare ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature and are identified as signatures\nof self-organized criticality. Standard meteorological theory cannot explain\nsatisfactorily the observed self-organized criticality. Numerical models for\nsimulation and prediction of atmospheric flows are subject to deterministic\nchaos and give unrealistic solutions. Deterministic chaos is a direct\nconsequence of round-off error growth in iterative computations. Round-off\nerror of finite precision computations doubles on an average at each step of\niterative computations. Round-off error will propagate to the mainstream\ncomputation and give unrealistic solutions in numerical weather prediction\n(NWP) and climate models which incorporate thousands of iterative computations\nin long-term numerical integration schemes. A recently developed\nnon-deterministic cell dynamical system model for atmospheric flows predicts\nthe observed self-organized criticality as intrinsic to quantumlike mechanics\ngoverning flow dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2001 16:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
