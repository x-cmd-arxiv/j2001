For the first half of our 44 ksec observation, the source was in a\nquiescent state with constant X-ray flux, after which it flared, reaching twice\nthe quiescent flux in 12 ksec, then decreasing. We analyze the emission-line\nspectrum and continuum during quiescent and flaring states. The differential\nemission measure derived from lines fluxes shows a hot corona with a continuous\ndistribution in temperature. During the non-flare state, the distribution peaks\nnear log T = 7.2, and when flaring, near 7.6. High-temperature lines are\nenhanced slightly during the flare, but most of the change occurs in the\ncontinuum. Coronal abundance anomalies are apparent, with iron very deficient\nrelative to oxygen and significantly weaker than expected from photospheric\nmeasurements, while neon is enhanced relative to oxygen. We find no evidence of\nappreciable resonant scattering optical depth in line ratios of iron and\noxygen. The flare light curve is consistent with Solar two-ribbon flare models,\nbut with a very long reconnection time-constant of about 65 ks. We infer loop\nlengths of about 0.05 stellar radii, to about 0.25 in the flare, if the flare\nemission originated from a single, low-density loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2001 21:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
