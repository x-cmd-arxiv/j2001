The propagation of the cannonballs in the\nGalactic disk and halo is studied. Two mechanisms for the acceleration of the\nobserved CRs are proposed. The first is based on ultrarelativistic shocks in\nthe interstellar medium and could accelerate the bulk of CRs up to the ``knee''\nenergy of 4 x 10(15) eV. The second operates with second-order Fermi\nacceleration within the cannonball. If the total initial energy of the ejected\nplasmoids in a SN explosion is 10(53) ergs or higher this second mechanism may\nexplain the CR spectrum above the knee up to the highest observed energies. It\nis shown that together with plausible assumptions about CR propagation in the\nGalactic confinement volume the observed spectral indices of the CR spectrum\ncan be theoretically understood to first order.

The\nphysical phenomena in 1T or 2T physics are not different, but the spacetime\nformalism used to describe them is. The 2T description involves two extra\ndimensions (one time and one space), is more symmetric, and makes manifest many\nhidden features of 1T-physics. One such hidden feature is that families of\napparently different 1T-dynamical systems in d dimensions holographically\ndescribe the same 2T system in d+2 dimensions. In 2T-physics there are two\ntimelike dimensions, but there is also a crucial gauge symmetry that thins out\nspacetime, thus making 2T-physics effectively equivalent to 1T-physics. The\ngauge symmetry is also responsible for ensuring causality and unitarity in a\nspacetime with two timelike dimensions. What is gained through 2T-physics is a\nunification of diverse 1T dynamics by making manifest hidden symmetries and\nrelationships among them. Such symmetries and relationships is the evidence for\nthe presence of the underlying higher dimensional spacetime structure.\n2T-physics could be viewed as a device for gaining a better understanding of\n1T-physics, but beyond this, 2T-physics offers new vistas in the search of the\nunified theory while raising deep questions about the meaning of spacetime. In\nthese lectures, the recent developments in the powerful gauge field theory\nformulation of 2T-physics will be described after a brief review of the results\nobtained so far in the more intuitive worldline approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2001 19:19:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2001 23:50:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2001 23:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
