In the Landau gauge, the\nequations are free of renormalization constants, and the renormalization point\ndependence enters only through the renormalized coupling and the renormalized\npropagator functions. The structure of the equations enables us to devise novel\ntruncations with solutions that are multiplicatively renormalizable and agree\nwith the leading order perturbative results. We show that, for infrared power\nlaw behaved propagators, the leading infrared behavior of the gluon equation is\nnot solely determined by the ghost loop, as concluded in previous studies, but\nthat the gluon loop, the three-gluon loop, the four-gluon loop, and even\nmassless quarks also contribute to the infrared analysis. In our new Landau\ngauge truncation, the combination of gluon and ghost loop contributions seems\nto reject infrared power law solutions, but massless quark loops illustrate how\nadditional contributions to the gluon vacuum polarization could reinstate these\nsolutions. Moreover, a schematic study of the three-gluon and four-gluon loops\nshows that they too need to be considered in more detail before a definite\nconclusion about the existence of infrared power behaved gluon and ghost\npropagators can be reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2001 09:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-14"}

The reservoir is described by\na complex Gaussian-Markovian field coupled to the nondiagonal elements of the\nTLS Hamiltonian. The theory can be relevant for electromagnetic interactions in\nmicrowave high-$Q$ cavities and muon spin depolarization. Analytical results\nare obtained for the strong-coupling regime, $\\Omega_0\\gg\\nu$, where $\\Omega_0$\nis the rms coupling amplitude (Rabi frequency) and $\\nu$ is the width of the\nreservoir spectrum. In this regime, the population difference and half of the\ninitial coherence decay with two characteristic rates: the most part of the\ndecay occurs at $t\\sim\\Omega_0^{-1}$, the relaxation being reversible for\n$t\\ll(\\Omega_0^2\\nu)^{-1/3}$, whereas for $t\\gg(\\Omega_0^2\\nu)^{-1/3}$ the\nrelaxation becomes irreversible and is practically over. The other half of the\ncoherence decays with the rate on the order of $\\nu$, which may be slower by\norders of magnitude than the time scale of the population relaxation. The above\nfeatures are explained by the fact that at $t\\ll\\nu^{-1}$ the reservoir\ntemporal fluctuations are effectively one-dimensional (adiabatic).
