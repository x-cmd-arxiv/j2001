Or, equivalently: Is the chromosphere heated continually, or only\nfor a few seconds once every three minutes? Two types of empirical model, one\nessentially time independent and always hot, the other highly time dependent\nand mostly cold, come to fundamentally different conclusions. This paper\nanalyzes the time-dependent model of the quiet, nonmagnetic chromosphere by\nCarlsson & Stein (1994: CS94) and shows that it predicts deep absorption lines,\nnone of which is observed; intensity fluctuations in the Lyman continuum that\nare much larger than observed; and time-averaged emission that falls far short\nof the observed emission. The paper concludes that the solar chromosphere,\nwhile time dependent, is never cold and dark. The same conclusion applies for\nstellar chromospheres.\n  A complete, time-dependent model of the nonmagnetic chromosphere must\ndescribe two phenomena: (1) dynamics, like that modeled by CS94 for\nchromospheric bright points but corrected for the geometrical properties of\nshocks propagating in an upward-expanding channel; and (2) the energetically\nmore important general, sustained heating of the chromosphere, as described by\ncurrent time-independent empirical models, but modified in the upper\nphotosphere for the formation of molecular absorption lines of CO in a\ndynamical medium.
