This seems in contradiction with the large lithium variations\nobserved in younger stars. It is also difficult to understand theoretically as\nlithium nuclei are easily destroyed by nuclear reactions, and subject to\nmicroscopic diffusion which, in the case of halo stars, should also lead to\ndepletion. Several ideas have been proposed to account for the lithium behavior\nin halo stars. The most promising possibilities were rotational-induced mixing,\nwhich could reduce lithium in the same way for all the stars, and mass-loss,\nwhich could oppose the lithium settling. In both cases however, the parameters\nshould be tightly adjusted to prevent any dispersion in the final results.\nVauclair 1999 (paper I) pointed out that the mu-gradient terms which appear in\nthe computations of the meridional circulation velocity were not introduced in\nprevious computations of rotationally-induced mixing. This can lead to a\nself-regulating process which reduces the efficiency of the meridional\ncirculation as well as the microscopic diffusion. Here we present numerical\ncomputations of this process and its influence on the lithium abundance\nvariations in halo stars. We show that in slowly rotating stars, under some\nconditions, lithium can be depleted by a factor of up to two with a dispersion\nsmaller than 0.1 dex in the middle part of the lithium plateau.

The\nsources are: the first generations of very massive (>100 solar masses) stars\nthat are formed from Big Bang debris and are distinct from SNII, and two types\nof SNII, the H and L events, which can occur only at [Fe/H]>-3. The H events\nare of high frequency and produce dominantly heavy (A>130) r-elements but no Fe\n(presumably leaving behind black holes). The L events are of low frequency and\nproduce Fe and dominantly light (A<130) r-elements (essentially none above Ba).\nBy using the observed abundances in two ultra-metal-poor stars and the solar\nr-abundances, the initial or prompt inventory of elements produced by the first\ngenerations of very massive stars and the yields of H and L events can be\ndetermined. The abundances of a large number of elements in a star can then be\ncalculated from the model by using only the observed Eu and Fe abundances.

Well-defined Ag sp quantum-well states (QWS) have been observed at\ndiscrete energies between 0.5-2eV below the Fermi level, and their dispersions\nhave been measured along the GammaK, GammaMM'and GammaL symmetry directions.\nQWS show a parabolic bidimensional dispersion, with in-plane effective mass of\n0.38-0.50mo, along the GammaK and GammaMM' directions, whereas no dispersion\nhas been found along the GammaL direction, indicating the low-dimensional\nelectronic character of these states. The binding energy dependence of the QWS\nas a function of Ag film thickness has been analyzed in the framework of the\nphase accumulation model. According to this model, a reflectivity of 70% has\nbeen estimated for the Ag-sp states at the Ag/H/Si(111)-(1x1) interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2001 09:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Our hypothesis is that singularities in 4D\nare induced by the separation of spacetime from the other dimensions. We\nexamine this hypothesis in the context of the so-called canonical or warp\nmetrics in 5D. These metrics are popular because they provide a clean\nseparation between the extra dimension and spacetime. We show that the\nspacetime section, in these metrics, inevitably becomes singular for some\nfinite (non-zero) value of the extra coordinate. This is true for all canonical\nmetrics that are solutions of the field equations in space-time-matter theory.\nThis is a geometrical singularity in 5D, but appears as a physical one in 4D.\nAt this singular hypersurface, the determinant of the spacetime metric becomes\nzero and the curvature of the spacetime blows up to infinity. These results are\nconsistent with our hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2001 10:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

If R is commutative (or PI, or FBN) the topology is equivalent to\nthe Zariski topology, and when R is the first Weyl algebra (in characteristic\nzero) we obtain a one-dimensional irreducible noetherian topological space.\nComparisons with topologies induced from those on A.

Simulations of QCD on lattice at zero baryon density\nindicate that the transition occurs at $T_c \\sim 150-170$ MeV. The calculations\nindicate that transition is likely to be second order or a cross over\nphenomenon. Although the lattice simulations have not given any indication on\nwhen the transition occurs at nonzero baryon density, the transition is\nexpected to occur around the densities of few times nuclear matter density.\nAlso, there is a strong reason to believe that the quark matter formed after\nthe phase transition is in colour superconducting phase. The matter densities\nin the interior of neutron stars are expected to be several times the nuclear\nmatter density and therefore the neutron star cores may possibly consist of\nquark matter. One then expects that this quark matter is formed during the\ncollapse of supernova. Starting with the assumption that the quark matter, when\nformed consists of predominantly u and d quarks, we consider the evolution of\nstrange quarks by weak interactions in the present work. The reaction rates and\ntime required to reach the chemical equilibrium are computed here. Our\ncalculations show that the chemical equilibrium is reached in about $10^{-7}$\nseconds. Further more during and immediately after the equilibration process\nenormous amount of energy is released and copious numbers of neutrinos are\nproduced.

This property also implies that these type of states, which form an N-1\ndimensional subspace of the atomic subsytem, also decohere slower. We propose a\nscheme which will create such states. First the two-level atoms are placed in a\nstrongly detuned cavity and one of the atoms, called the control atom is\nexcited. The time evolution of the coupled atom-cavity system leads to an\nappropriately entangled state of the atoms.

A decomposition which achieves this\nminimum is called an optimal decomposition. However, as for the entanglement of\nformation, there is not much known about the structure of such optimal\ndecompositions, except for some special cases, like states of two qubits or\nisotropic states. Here we present a necessary and sufficient condition for a\nset of pure states of a finite dimensional bipartite system to form an optimal\ndecomposition. This condition is well suited to treat the question, whether the\nentanglement of formation is additive or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2001 11:14:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2001 16:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The Lamb-Dicke regime is achieved in the\nlattice direction whereas the transverse confinement is much weaker. The\nemployed sideband cooling method, first studied by Vuletic et al.\\cite{Vule98},\nuses Raman transitions between Zeeman levels and produces a spin-polarized\nsample. We present a detailed study of this cooling method and investigate the\nrole of elastic collisions in the system. We accumulate $83(5)%$ of the atoms\nin the vibrational ground state of the strongly confined motion, and elastic\ncollisions cool the transverse motion to a temperature of $2.8 \\mu $K=$0.7\n\\hbar\\omega_{\\rm osc}/k_{\\rm B}$, where $\\omega_{\\rm osc}$ is the oscillation\nfrequency in the strongly confined direction. The sample then approaches the\nregime of a quasi-2D cold gas. We analyze the limits of this cooling method and\npropose a dynamical change of the trapping potential as a mean of cooling the\natomic sample to still lower temperatures. Measurements of the rate of\nthermalization between the weakly and strongly confined degrees of freedom are\ncompatible with the zero energy scattering resonance observed previously in\nweak 3D traps. For the explored temperature range the measurements agree with\nrecent calculations of quasi-2D collisions\\cite{Petr01}. Transparent analytical\nmodels reproduce the expected behavior for $k_{\\rm B}T \\gg \\hbar \\omega_{\\rm\nosc}$ and also for $k_{\\rm B}T \\ll \\hbar \\omega_{\\rm osc}$ where the 2D\nfeatures are prominent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2001 13:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}
