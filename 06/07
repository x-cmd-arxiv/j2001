The masers at 229.8 GHz belong\nto class I, whereas those at 108.9 GHz belong to class II, according to the\nclassification by Menten (1991). The masers in DR 21(OH) and DR 21West can be\nroughly fitted by models with the gas kinetic temperature of the order of 50K.\nThe detection of the 108.9 GHz masers towards G345.01+1.79 and M 8E may\nindicate on a specific geometry of these objects. The combination of the\nexistence of the class II J_0-J_{-1}E masers towards W 3(OH), G345.01+1.79, W\n48, and Cep A and our non-detection of the 3_{-2}-4_{-1}E and J_1-J_0E lines is\nan evidence that the class II masers in these objects are pumped by the\nradiation of hot dust rather than by that of UC HII-regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2001 15:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
