For a single generation of field stars,\nthe results confirm previous analyses based upon the assumption of a linear\ngradient with galactocentric distance. Though the dispersion in metallicity at\na given radius grows with time, the underlying slope across the disk remains\nunchanged. For a disk dominated by a discontinuity in [Fe/H] beyond the solar\ncircle, but no gradient within the inner or outer disk, a gradient is derived\nfor any sample whose galactocentric baseline overlaps the discontinuity. The\nconsequence of orbital diffusion is to shift the observable edge of the\ntransition in [Fe/H] to smaller galactocentric distance. In contrast, star\nclusters of a single generation evaporate so quickly that the small surviving\nsample of the oldest clusters is statistically insufficient to define any but a\nlinear gradient. Inclusion of multiple generations of stars and clusters with a\nplausible age-metallicity relation enhances these patterns by expanding the\nmetallicity range at a given galactocentric distance through the inclusion of\nstars with a wide range in both age and galactocentric origin. For field stars,\nthe metallicity distribution of stars in the solar neighborhood is virtually\nindistinguishable for the two cases modelled. Because ages, abundances, and\ndistances can be reliably determined for clusters and any sample of clusters is\ninvariably dominated by clusters formed over the last 2 Gyrs, the cluster\npopulation offers a means for finding detailed structure within the recent\ngalactic abundance gradient. Using clusters to extend the galactocentric\nbaseline would supply an additional critical test of the discontinuity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2001 16:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Thus, in addition to the dusty torus, the circumnuclear\nstarburst region and host galaxy are important in hiding the broad-line region.\n  Morphologically, starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies are of later types and\nmore strongly interacting than AGN-dominant Seyfert galaxies.

We investigate the fluctuations in energy\nof the oscillator and discuss the trace the oscillator leaves in the bath. Most\nof the work deals with two-level systems coupled to a bosonic bath (a\ntransmission line). For two-level systems with a Hamiltonian that commutes with\nthe total Hamiltonian (system plus coupling plus bath) the ground state is a\npure state. The energy of the system is a constant of motion. For the general\ncase, the energy of the two-level system fluctuates, and the ground state is\nonly partially coherent. A particular realization of such a two level system\nconsists of a mesoscopic ring with a quantum dot coupled capacitively to a\ntransmission line. In the presence of an Aharonov-Bohm flux this system\nexhibits a persistent current. This current is a measure of the coherence of\nthe ground state. As a function of the coupling strength the ground state\nundergoes a crossover from a state characterized by a time-averaged persistent\ncurrent which is much larger than its time-averaged mean squared fluctuations\nto a state characterized by a persistent current with an average amplitude that\nis much smaller than its mean squared fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2001 09:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

If we employ ``reflective'' boundary conditions, all modes are\nnon-super-radiant. On the other hand, for ``transparent'' boundary conditions,\nthe presence of super-radiance depends on our definition of positive frequency.\nFor those KN-AdS black holes having a globally time-like Killing vector, the\nnatural choice of positive frequency leads to no super-radiance. For other\nKN-AdS black holes, there is a choice of positive frequency which gives no\nsuper-radiance, but for other choices there will, in general, be\nsuper-radiance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2001 14:08:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2001 13:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

However, if different free limits are authorized, cross-couplings\nbecome possible. An explicit example is given.
