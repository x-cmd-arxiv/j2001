We assume that the gas density profile traces\nthe dark matter density profile in outer parts of the haloes, as suggested by\nmany hydrodynamic simulations. Under this assumption, the hydrostatic\nequilibrium uniquely fixes the two free parameters in the model, the\nmass-temperature normalization and the polytropic index, that determine the\ntemperature profile. This enables us to predict a universal gas profile from\nany universal dark matter profile. Our results show that gas tracing dark\nmatter in the outer parts of the haloes is inconsistent with gas being\nisothermal; on the contrary, it requires temperature to decrease slowly with\nradius, in agreement with observations. We compare our predictions for X-ray\nsurface brightness profiles of the haloes and the mass-temperature relation\nwith observations. We find that they are generally in a good agreement. We\ncompare the universal profile with the beta profile and find that, although the\nbeta profile gives a reasonable fit to our predicted profiles, the deviation\nfrom it can explain many of the observed trends, once we take into account the\nobservational selection effects. Our model predicts that the mass-temperature\nrelation does not follow the self-similar relation because of the\nmass-dependent halo concentration. We also predict surface brightness profiles\nof the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect.

The sensitivity of the domain wall response to field direction\nsuggests that electrostatic energy contributions play a crucial role in the\nobserved switching properties. We can explain our results in terms of the\npolarization charges and the resulting depolarization fields associated with\nangled domain walls. A phenomenological Landau-Ginzburg analysis of a tilted\ndomain boundary indicates that such electrostatic effects reduce its local\nswitching barrier, thereby enhancing its field-induced mobility compared to\nthat of its untilted counterpart. Consequently not all domain walls are equally\nmobile. Furthermore the switching efficiency of a particular domain is\ndetermined by its allowed final states, as defined by its neighbors.

Abstract: The development of ``(static)\noperational quantum logic\" points out that classical boolean structures are too\nrigid to describe the actual and potential properties of quantum systems. On\nthe other hand, an intuitionistic perspective on operational quantum logic,\nguides us in the direction of incorporating dynamics logically by reconsidering\nthe primitive propositions required to describe the behavior of a quantum\nsystem, in particular in view of the emergent disjunctivity due to the\nnon-determinism of quantum measurements. A further elaboration on\n\"intuitionistic quantum logic\" emerges into a \"dynamic operational quantum\nlogic\", which allows us to express dynamic reasoning in the sense that we can\ncapture how actual properties propagate, including their temporal causal\nstructure, and provides a unified logical description of systems which evolve\nor which are submitted to measurements. This setting reveals that even static\noperational quantum logic bears a hidden dynamic ingredient in terms of what is\ncalled \"the orthomodularity\" of the lattice-structure. Focusing on the quantale\nsemantics for dynamic operational quantum logic, we delineate some points of\ndifference with the existing quantale semantics for (non)-commutative linear\nlogic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2001 17:00:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2001 19:38:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2001 20:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2001 12:22:57 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2002 19:11:30 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 6 May 2002 20:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
