An entangled state of a system consisting of two subsystems cannot\nbe described as a product of the quantum states of the two subsystems. In this\nsense the entangled system is considered inseparable and nonlocal. It is\ngenerally believed that entanglement manifests itself mostly in systems\nconsisting of a small number of microscopic particles. Here we demonstrate\nexperimentally the entanglement of two objects, each consisting of about 10^12\natoms. Entanglement is generated via interaction of the two objects - more\nprecisely, two gas samples of cesium atoms - with a pulse of light, which\nperforms a non-local Bell measurement on collective spins of the samples. The\nentangled spin state can be maintained for 0.5 millisecond. Besides being of\nfundamental interest, the robust, long-lived entanglement of material objects\ndemonstrated here is expected to be useful in quantum information processing,\nincluding teleportation of quantum states of matter and quantum memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2001 16:54:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2001 08:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
