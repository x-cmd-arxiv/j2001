This is due to the geographic\ndistribution of resources that are owned by different organizations. The\nresource owners of each of these resources have different usage or access\npolicies and cost models, and varying loads and availability. In order to\naddress complex resource management issues, we have proposed a computational\neconomy framework for resource allocation and for regulating supply and demand\nin Grid computing environments.

The dependence of the isospin symmetry energy\ncoefficient on the neutron proton (n-p) asymmetry may be determined unless by a\nconstant (exponent) $Z$ which depend on microscopic properties. The dependence\nof the generalized symmetry energy coefficients with Skyrme forces on the n-p\nasymmetry and on the density, only from .5 up to 1.5 $\\rho_0$, are investigated\nin the isospin and scalar channels. The use of Skyrme-type effective forces\nallows us to obtain analytical expressions for these parameters as well as\ntheir dependences on the neutron-proton (n-p) asymmetry, density and even\ntemperature. Whereas the density dependence of these coefficients obtained with\nSkyrme forces is not necessarily realistic the dependence on the n-p asymmetry\nexhibit a more consistent behaviour. The isospin symmetry energy coefficient\n(s.e.c.) increases as the n-p asymmetry acquires higher values whereas the\nisoscalar s.e.c. decreases. Some consequences for the Supernovae mechanism are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2001 14:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

(Here we take the entanglement of\nformation as our measure of entanglement.) For n=3 and d=2, that is, for a\nsystem of three qubits, the answer is known: Emax(3,2) = 0.550. In this paper\nwe consider first a system of d qudits and show that Emax(d,d) is greater than\nor equal to 1. We then consider a system of three particles, with three\ndifferent values of d.
