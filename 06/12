The RR\nLyraes are distributed almost evenly between Sgr and the Milky Way. For Sgr\nmembers, the average periods are 0.574 day and 0.322 day for RRab and RRc stars\nrespectively. This places Sgr in the long-period tail of the Oosterhoff I\ngroup. We report the detection of 53 double-mode RR Lyrae stars (RRd) within\nour sample. The magnitude of 40 of these stars is consistent with membership in\nSgr whereas 13 RRds are located within our Galaxy. We also found 13 RR Lyraes\n(5 in Sgr and 8 in the Galaxy) exhibiting two closely spaced frequencies, most\nprobably related to non-radial pulsations. The period distribution of the RR\nLyrae variables in Sgr is compared to those of other Milky Way satellites. We\nfind a remarkable similarity between the RR Lyrae populations in Sgr and the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC), suggesting that these galaxies have similar\nhorizontal branch morphologies. This may indicate that Sgr and the LMC started\ntheir formation under similar conditions. Using various photometric indicators,\nwe estimate the metallicity of the RR Lyrae stars in Sgr and find <[Fe/H]>~-1.6\ndex with a dispersion of ~ +/-0.5 dex around this value and a minor but\nsignificant population at <-2.0 dex. We do not find evidence for a spatial\nmetallicity gradient in the RR Lyrae population of Sgr. From the spatial\ndistribution of RR Lyraes, we estimate the RRab content and total luminosity of\nthis galaxy and find MV(Sgr)~-14.7 mag, a value that would be consistent with\nthe empirical metallicity/luminosity relation for Dsph galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2001 18:39:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Here we consider high-power, FRII radio galaxies and shock\nheating of the intracluster medium (ICM, including the case of the\nintergalactic medium prior to cluster formation) by their large-scale jets.\nBased on the observed statistics of radio galaxies in clusters and their\nevolution, along with the most reasonable assumptions, it is shown that they\ncan provide the ICM with excess specific energies of 1--2 keV per particle,\nmainly during the redshift interval $z \\sim 1-3$. This naturally meets the\nrequirements of cluster evolution models with non-gravitational feedback in\naccounting for the observed deviations in the X-ray luminosity-temperature\nrelation. In contrast to supernovae, such large-scale jets deposit their energy\ndirectly into the low density ICM outside galaxies, and are much less\nsusceptible to radiative losses. As a clear and potentially decisive test of\nthis scenario, we propose the observation of `prompt' high energy gamma-rays\nemitted by shock-accelerated, non-thermal electrons during the epoch of ICM\nheating by radio galaxies, which may be feasible with the {\\it GLAST}\nsatellite.

The strong variability seen in several sources points\nto massive black holes as the central engines. If the flux is isotropic, the\nluminosities range up to roughly 10^41 erg/s, implying masses of M>10^3 Msun if\nthe luminosity is sub-Eddington. Here we explore a model for these sources. We\nsuggest that in some tens of percent of globular clusters a very massive black\nhole, M>50 Msun, is formed. This black hole sinks in <10^6 yr to the center of\nthe cluster, where in the 10^10 yr lifetime of the cluster it accretes roughly\n10^3 Msun, primarily in the form of lighter black holes. Unlike less massive\nblack holes in binaries, which are flung from clusters by recoil before they\ncan merge gravitationally, a >50 Msun black hole has enough inertia that it\nremains bound to the cluster. We suggest that 10^3 Msun black holes may be\ncommon in the centers of dense globular clusters, and may therefore exist in\nsome tens of percent of current globulars. If the cluster later merges with its\nhost galaxy, accretion from young star clusters in molecular clouds by the\nblack hole can generate luminosity consistent with that observed.

The order parameter\n$\\phi$ is the mean square velocity of the impurity particle relative to that of\na fluid particle, and the control parameter $\\xi$ is the fluid cooling rate\nrelative to the impurity collision rate. For $\\xi<1$ there is a ``normal''\nphase for which $\\phi$ scales as the fluid/impurity mass ratio, just as for a\nsystem with elastic collisions. For $\\xi>1$ an ``ordered'' phase occurs in\nwhich $\\phi$ is finite even for vanishingly small mass ratio, representing an\nextreme violation of energy equipartition. The phenomenon can be described in\nterms of a Landau-like free energy for a second order phase transition. The\ndynamics leading to the HCS is studied in detail using an asymptotic analysis\nof the Enskog-Lorentz kinetic equation near each phase and the critical domain.\nCritical slowing is observed with a divergent relaxation time at the critical\npoint. The stationary velocity distributions are determined in each case,\nshowing a crossover from Maxwellian in the normal phase to an exponential\nquartic function of the velocity that is sharply peaked about the non-zero\n$\\phi$ for the ordered phase. It is shown that the diffusion coefficient in the\nnormal phase diverges at the critical point and remains so in the ordered\nphase. This is interpreted as a transition from diffusive to ballistic dynamics\nbetween the normal and ordered phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2001 16:00:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2001 15:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

If R is a non-integer the dynamics is discontinuous and non-KAM. We\nhave explored the role of R in controlling the localization properties of the\neigenstates.

Of particular importance here is the fact\nthat all the operations needed in the quantum (statistical) mechanics of spin\n1/2 particles can be carried out in the ``even subalgebra'' of the MSTA. This\nenables us to ``lift'' existing results in quantum information theory regarding\nentanglement, decoherence and the quantum/classical transition to space-time.\nThe full power of the MSTA and its geometric interpretation can then be used to\nobtain new insights into these foundational issues in quantum theory. A system\nof spin 1/2 particles located at fixed positions in space, and interacting with\nan external magnetic field and/or with one another via their intrinsic magnetic\ndipoles provides a simple paradigm for the study of these issues. This paradigm\ncan further be easily realized and studied in the laboratory by nuclear\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2001 10:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
