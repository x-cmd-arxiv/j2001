The use of a physical nuclear equation of state allows us to follow\nthe thermodynamic history of the stellar medium and to compute the energy and\nlepton number loss due to the emission of neutrinos. The computed models differ\nconcerning the neutron star masses and mass ratios, the neutron star spins, the\nnumerical resolution expressed by the cell size of the finest grid and the\nnumber of grid levels, and the calculation of the temperature from the solution\nof the entropy equation instead of the energy equation. Our simulations show\nthat the details of the gravitational-wave emission are still sensitive to the\nnumerical resolution, even in our highest-quality calculations. The amount of\nmass which can be ejected from neutron star mergers depends strongly on the\nangular momentum of the system. Our results do not support the initial\nconditions of temperature and proton-to-nucleon ratio assumed in recent work\nfor producing a solar r-process pattern for nuclei around and above the A\napprox 130 peak. The improved models confirm our previous conclusion that\ngamma-ray bursts are not powered by neutrino emission during the dynamical\nphase of the merging of two neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2001 09:26:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2001 14:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
