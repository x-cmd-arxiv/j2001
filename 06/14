One such galaxy is\nclearly identified among the 6 calibrating galaxies with Cepheid distances. As\nthe Tolman-Bondi model predicts the expected distance ratio to the Virgo\ndistance, this galaxy can still be used to estimate the Virgo distance, and the\naverage value over the 6 galaxies is 15.4 +- 0.5 Mpc.\n  Well-known background groups of galaxies are clearly recovered, together with\nfilaments of galaxies which link these groups to the main cluster, and are\nfalling into it.

For parameters from the\n  SMA and LOW solutions the effect is localized at low energies (E<10 MeV) and\nis not larger than 10 %. The Earth matter effects can be revealed (i) by the\nobservation of oscillatory distortions of the energy spectra in a single\nexperiment and (ii) by the comparison between the spectra at different\ndetectors. For a supernova at distance D=10 Kpc, comparing the results of\nSuperKamiokande (SK), SNO and LVD experiments one can establish the effect at\n(2-3) \\sigma level, whereas larger statistical significance ((4-5) \\sigma) is\nobtained if two experiments of SK-size or larger are available.
