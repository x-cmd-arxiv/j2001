To focus attention on the\ncapabilities of this technique, a restricted, circular and planar three-body\nsystem is considered and the dynamics of its outer planet while captured in a\nresonance with the inner body is studied.

The driving force of this pendulum corresponds to the gravitational\nattraction of the inner body and its contribution, at different resonant\nstates, is shown to be proportional to e^s, where s is the order of the\nresonance and e is the orbital eccentricity of the outer planet.

The mean accretion rate per\ngalaxy declines from ~40 M_sun/yr at z=2 to ~10 M_sun/yr at z=0, while the\nmerging rate peaks later (z~1) and declines more slowly, so by z=0 the ratio is\nabout 2:1.

Some of the conformal\nfixed-point theories can also be obtained within Landau-Ginzburg theories. We\nobtain the complete spectra (with multiplicities) of exact conformal weights of\nstates (or corresponding local operators) in the isolated fixed-point conformal\nfield theories, and at one special point on each of the lines of fixed points.\nAlthough the conformal weights are rational, the conformal field theories are\nnot, and (with one exception) do not contain the affine versions of their\nsuperalgebras in their chiral algebras. The method involves lattice models that\nrepresent the strong-coupling region, which can be mapped to loop models, and\nthen to a Coulomb gas with modified boundary conditions. The results apply to\npercolation, dilute and dense polymers, and other statistical mechanics models,\nand also to the spin quantum Hall transition in noninteracting fermions with\nquenched disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2001 20:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We prove that some are\nconsiderably more complex to invert since the number of required time steps and\nthe slow-down of the reversed evolutions are necessarily of the order n.\nFurthermore, the spins have to be addressed separately. We show for which\nvalues of the coupling parameters the phase transition between simple and\ncomplex time-reversal schemes occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2001 14:31:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2002 16:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
