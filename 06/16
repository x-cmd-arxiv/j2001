The flares are located\nabove a cold accretion disk -- either on or off the rotation axis. For on- or\noff-axis flares, the upward/outward bulk motion causes a reduction of the iron\nKalpha line width. To a distant observer with a low inclination angle (\\theta_o\n\\simlt 30deg.), larger upward/outward bulk velocities decrease the extension of\nthe red wing, with little change in the location of the blue `edge'. In\ncontrast, an observer at a large inclination angle (e.g. \\theta_o=60deg.) sees\nboth the red wing and the blue `edge' change with the bulk velocity.
