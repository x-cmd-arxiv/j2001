We confirm recent work indicating that\nthe stars-with-planet sample as a whole is iron rich. However, the lowest mass\nstars tend to be iron poor, with several having [Fe/H]<-0.2, demonstrating that\nhigh metallicity is not required for the formation of short period Jupiter-mass\nplanets. We show that the average [Fe/H] increases with increasing stellar mass\n(for masses below 1.25 solar masses) in both samples, but that the increase is\nmuch more rapid in the stars-with-planet sample. The variation of metallicity\nwith stellar age also differs between the two samples. We examine possible\nselection effects related to variations in the sensitivity of radial velocity\nsurveys with stellar mass and metallicity, and identify a color cutoff\n(B-V>0.48) that contributes to but does not explain the mass-metallicity trend\nin the stars-with-planets sample. We use Monte Carlo models to show that adding\nan average of 6.5 Earth masses of iron to each star can explain both the\nmass-metallicity and the age-metallicity relations of the stars-with-planets\nsample. However, for at least one star, HD 38529, there is good evidence that\nthe bulk metallicity is high. We conclude that the observed metallicities and\nmetallicity trends are the result of the interaction of three effects;\naccretion of about 6 Earth masses of iron rich material, selection effects, and\nin some cases, high intrinsic metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2001 04:42:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We study in some detail the\nalgebra of the appropriate two-point correlators, and give a careful discussion\nas to how one can approach the world-sheet renormalization group infrared fixed\npoint, in the neighborhood of which the logarithmic algebra is valid. It is\nfound that, if the initial RW spacetime does not have cosmological horizons,\nthen there is no problem in approaching the fixed point. However, in the\npresence of horizons, there are world-sheet divergences which imply the need\nfor Liouville dressing in order to approach the fixed point in the correct way.\nA detailed analysis on the subtle subtraction of these divergences in the\nlatter case is given. In both cases, at the fixed point, the recoil-induced\nspacetime is nothing other than a coordinate transformation of the initial\nspacetime into the rest frame of the recoiling D-particle. However, in the\nhorizon case, if one identifies the Liouville mode with the target time, which\nexpresses physically the back reaction of the recoiling D-particle onto the\nspacetime structure, it is found that the induced spacetime distortion results\nin the removal of the initial cosmological horizon and the eventual stopping of\nthe acceleration of the Universe. In this latter sense, our model may be\nthought of as a conformal field theory description of a (toy) Universe\ncharacterized by a sort of `phase transition' at the moment of impulse,\nimplying a time-varying speed of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2001 19:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Random EM fluctuations are assumed to provide\nperturbations which can mimic some quantum phenomena while retaining a purely\nclassical basis, e.g. the Casimir force, the Van-der-Waals force, the Lamb\nshift, spontaneous emission, the RMS radius of the harmonic oscillator, and the\nradius of the Bohr atom. This classical ZPF is represented as a homogeneous,\nisotropic ensemble of plane waves with fixed amplitudes and random phases.\nAveraging over the random phases is assumed to be equivalent to taking the\nground-state expectation values of the corresponding quantum operator. We\ndemonstrate that this is not precisely correct by examining the statistics of\nthe classical ZPF in contrast to that of the EM quantum vacuum. We derive the\ndistribution for the individual mode amplitudes in the ground-state as\npredicted by quantum field theory (QFT) and then carry out the same calculation\nfor the classical ZPF analogue, showing that the distributions are only in\napproximate agreement, diverging as the density of k states decreases. We\nintroduce an alternative classical ZPF with a different stochastic character,\nand demonstrate that it can exactly reproduce the statistics of the EM vacuum\nof QED. Incorporated into SED, this new field is shown to give the correct (QM)\ndistribution for the amplitude of the ground-state of a harmonic oscillator,\nsuggesting the possibility of developing further successful correspondences\nbetween SED and QED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2001 21:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
