In order to\ncorrectly identify star forming galaxies in the redshift range 5<z<9 and\nearly-type galaxies above z>2 and avoid confusion with other SEDs it is\nmandatory to have photometric information in optical bands, besides a standard\nIR filter-set like F110 F160 K L M. In particular by adding the V606, I814 and\nz-Gunn filters a good discrimination is obtained above z>5 for star forming\ngalaxies and z>1 for early-types. The case for an extension of the NGST\nwavelength domain to the optical range is therefore strongly supported by this\nanalysis. The effects of leaks in the filter blocking have also been\ninvestigated. In spite of rather pessimistic assumptions (a constant leak at a\nlevel of 10^{-4} of the peak transmission over the whole spectral range or a\nleak of Gaussian shape placed at 1.5 times the effective wavelength of the\nfilter with an amplitude of 10^{-3} of the peak transmission and a width of 5%\nof the central wavelength) the effects are not dramatic: the accuracy of the\ndetermination of photometric redshifts with a standard V606 I814 z-Gunn F110\nF160 K L M filter set does not significantly deteriorate for a sample limited\nto M_AB~30. In the range 5.5<z<12.5 a rather high accuracy with a typical error\n|z_sim-z_phot|<=0.2 is achieved. With the filter blocking achieved by the\npresent standard technology, extended and continuous spectral coverage appears\nto be the driving factor to maximize the scientific output.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2001 09:06:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We analyze the problem in light of modern\nstatistical mechanics models of hysteresis. In particular, we compute the\ndemagnetization curve and derive the Rayleigh parameters a and b in the\nrandom-field Ising model and in a model of domain wall depinning. In the\nrandom-field Ising model the Rayleigh law is obeyed only in the disorder\ndominated phase, while in the low disorder phase it is not possible to\ndemagnetize the sample. This approach allows us to link a and b to\nmicrostructural parameters, such as the domain wall energy, the internal\ndisorder or the exchange interactions. Finally, our results are compared with\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2001 09:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2002 13:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
