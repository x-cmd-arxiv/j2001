Any neutrons originally present in the GRB fireball may, depending on\nthe characteristics of the central engine, dynamically decouple as the fireball\naccelerates. This leads to outflow consisting of separate fast proton and slow\nneutron components. We derive detailed implications of neutron decoupling for\nthe observed lightcurves of short bursts. We show that the collision of a\nneutron decayed shell with a decelerating outer shell is expected to result in\nan observable second peak in the GRB lightcurve. There may be substantial\noptical emission associated with such an event, so the upcoming Swift satellite\nmay be able to place constraints on models for short bursts.

PEGASE utilizes the Padova group tracks while\nSTARBURST99 uses the Geneva group tracks, allowing comparison between the two.\nWe used our MAPPINGS III code to compute photoionization models which include a\nself-consistent treatment of dust physics and chemical depletion. We use the\nstandard optical diagnostic diagrams as indicators of the hardness of the EUV\nradiation field in these galaxies. These diagnostic diagrams are most sensitive\nto the spectral index of the ionizing radiation field in the 1-4 Rydberg\nregion. We find that warm infrared starburst galaxies contain a relatively hard\nEUV field in this region. The PEGASE ionizing stellar continuum is harder in\nthe 1-4 Rydberg range than that of STARBURST99. As the spectrum in this regime\nis dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars, this difference is most\nlikely due to the differences in stellar atmosphere models used for the W-R\nstars. We believe that the stellar atmospheres in STARBURST99 are more\napplicable to the starburst galaxies in our sample, however they do not produce\nthe hard EUV field in the 1-4 Rydberg region required by our observations. The\ninclusion of continuum metal blanketing in the models may be one solution.\nSupernova remnant (SNR) shock modeling shows that the contribution by\nmechanical energy from SNRs to the photoionization models is << 20%. The models\npresented here are used to derive a new theoretical classification scheme for\nstarbursts and AGN galaxies based on the optical diagnostic diagrams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2001 08:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The method relies on defining the coboundary\noperator of the local Weyl group, and giving a cohomological interpretation to\ncounterterms in the effective action in dimensional regularization with respect\nto this group. Non-trivial cocycles of the Weyl group arise from local\nfunctionals that are Weyl invariant in and only in the physical even integer\ndimension. In the physical dimension the non-trivial cocycles generate\ncovariant non-local action functionals characterized by sensitivity to global\nWeyl rescalings. The non-local action so obtained is unique up to the addition\nof trivial cocycles and Weyl invariant terms, both of which are insensitive to\nglobal Weyl rescalings. These distinct behaviors under rigid dilations can be\nused to distinguish between infrared relevant and irrelevant operators in a\ngenerally covariant manner. Variation of the $d=4$ non-local effective action\nyields two new conserved geometric stress tensors with local traces. The method\nmay be extended to any even dimension by making use of the general construction\nof conformal invariants given by Fefferman and Graham. As a corollary,\nconformal field theory behavior of correlators at the asymptotic infinity of\neither anti-de Sitter or de Sitter spacetimes follows, i.e. AdS$_{d+1}$ or\ndeS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ correspondence. The same construction naturally selects all\ninfrared relevant terms (and only those terms) in the low energy effective\naction of gravity in any even integer dimension.

It is shown that the use of the\nFeynman approach to quantum theory in combination with the canonical approach\nallows one to extend quantum dynamics to describe the time evolution in the\ncase of such interactions. In this way, using only the current concepts of\nquantum theory, a generalized equation of motion for state vectors is derived.\nIn the case, where the fundamental interaction generating the dynamics in a\nsystem is local in time, this equation is equivalent to the Schr{\\\"o}dinger\nequation. Explicit examples are given for an exactly solvable model. The\nproposed formalism is shown to provide a new insight into the problem of the\ndescription of nonlocal interactions in quantum field theory. It is shown that\nsuch a property of the equation of motion as nonlocality in time may be\nimportant for describing hadron-hadron interactions at low and intermediate\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2001 12:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
