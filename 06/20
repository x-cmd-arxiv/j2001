We use a semi-analytic\nmodel to study the scientific yield of combining SZE data with X-ray and\noptical follow-up observations. If clusters at a given redshift z_o can be\nidentified with virialized, spherical halos, they populate a well-defined\n\"fundamental plane\" (FP) in the parameter space of the three observables:\nvirial temperature (T), total Sunyaev-Zeldovich flux decrement (DS), and\nangular size (theta). The location and orientation of the FP, as well as its\nredshift-evolution, are sensitive to both the internal evolution of clusters,\nand to the underlying cosmological parameters. We show that if clusters are not\nstandard candles (e.g. due to feedback, or energy injection), then this can be\ninferred from the FP. Likewise, we study the dependence of the FP on the\ncosmological parameters h, sigma_8, and Omega_0, and quantify constraints on\nthese parameters. We also show that in the absence of any non-gravitational\neffects, the scatter in the the (DS-T) plane is significantly smaller than in\neither the (theta-T) or the (theta-DS) planes. As a result, the (DS-T) relation\ncan be an exceptionally sensitive probe of both cluster physics and\ncosmological parameters, and a comparison of the amount of scatter in these\nthree scaling relations will serve as a test of the origin (cosmological vs.\nstochastic) of the scatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2001 19:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

In the first stages of\ndisk accretion or in the case of high mass protostars, the disk mass is likely\nto be sufficiently large, so that the disk self-gravity may have an impact on\nthe dynamics and the emission properties of the disk. In this paper we describe\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) produced by a simple, non-flaring,\nself-gravitating accretion disk model. Self-gravity is included in the\ncalculation of the rotation curve of the disk and in the energy balance\nequation, as a term of effective heating related to Jeans instability. In order\nto quantify in detail the requirements on the mass of the disk and on the\naccretion rate posed on the models by realistic situations, we compare the SEDs\nproduced by these models with the observed SEDs of a small sample of\nwell-studied protostellar objects. We find that relatively modest disks - even\nlighter than the central star - can lead to an interesting fit to the infrared\nSED of the FU Orionis objects considered, while in the case of T Tauri stars\nthe required parameters fall outside the range suggested as acceptable by the\ngeneral theoretical and observational scenario. On the basis of the present\nresults, we may conclude that the contribution of a self-gravitating disk is\nplausible in several cases (in particular, for FU Orionis objects) and that, in\nthe standard irradiation dominated disk scenario, it would help softening the\nrequirements encountered by Keplerian accretion models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2001 17:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Tunneling\nfixed points are a subset of `termination' fixed points, which describe\nboundary conditions on a multicomponent edge. The requirement of unitary time\nevolution at the boundary gives a nontrivial consistency condition for possible\nlow-energy boundary conditions. The effect of interactions and random hopping\non fixed points is studied through a perturbative RG approach which generalizes\nthe Giamarchi-Schulz RG for disordered Luttinger liquids to broken left-right\nsymmetry and multiple modes. The allowed termination points of a multicomponent\nedge are classified by a B-matrix with rational matrix elements. We apply our\napproach to a number of examples, such as tunneling between a quantum Hall edge\nand a superconductor and tunneling between two quantum Hall edges in the\npresence of interactions. Interactions are shown to induce a continuous\nrenormalization of effective tunneling charge for the integrable case of\ntunneling between two Laughlin states. The correlation functions of\nelectronlike operators across a junction are found from the B matrix using a\nsimple image-charge description, along with the induced lattice of boundary\noperators.

The good agreement with the data is in\ncontrast with the results of the existing non-relativistic approaches. In this\nwork we firstly make a complementary test of the LFD applying it to calculate\nanother important characteristic, the nucleon momentum distribution $n(q)$ of\nthe deuteron using six invariant functions $f_{i}$ $(i=1,...,6)$ instead of two\n($S$- and $D$-waves) in the nonrelativistic case. The comparison with the\n$y$-scaling data shows the decisive role of the function $f_{5}$ which at\n$q\\geq$ 500 MeV/c exceeds all other $f$-functions (as well as the $S$- and\n$D$-waves) for the correct description of $n(q)$ of the deuteron in the\nhigh-momentum region. Comparison with other calculations using $S$- and\n$D$-waves corresponding to various nucleon-nucleon potentials is made.\nSecondly, using clear indications that the high-momentum components of $n(q)$\nin heavier nuclei are related to those in the deuteron, we develop an approach\nwithin the natural orbital representation to calculate $n(q)$ in $(A,Z)$-nuclei\non the basis of the deuteron momentum distribution.
