In our first paper we provided 850 micron flux\ndensities for 104 galaxies selected from the IRAS Bright Galaxy Sample and we\nfound that the 60, 100 micron (IRAS) and 850 micron (SCUBA) fluxes could be\nadequately fitted by emission from dust at a single temperature. In this paper\nwe present 450 micron data for the galaxies. With the new data, the spectral\nenergy distributions of the galaxies can no longer be fitted with an isothermal\ndust model - two temperature components are now required. Using our 450 micron\ndata and fluxes from the literature, we find that the 450/850 micron flux ratio\nfor the galaxies is remarkably constant and this holds from objects in which\nthe star formation rate is similar to our own Galaxy, to ultraluminous infrared\ngalaxies (ULIRGS) such as Arp 220. The only possible explanation for this is if\nthe dust emissivity index for all of the galaxies is ~2 and the cold dust\ncomponent has a similar temperature in all galaxies (20-21 K). The dust masses\nestimated using the new temperatures are higher by a factor ~2 than those\ndetermined previously using a single temperature. This brings the gas-to-dust\nratios of the IRAS galaxies into agreement with those of the Milky Way and\nother spiral galaxies which have been intensively studied in the submm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2001 17:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Our sample of SNe Ib obeys a tight relation between the\nvelocity at the photosphere, as determined from the Fe II features, and the\ntime relative to that of maximum light. From this we infer that the masses and\nthe kinetic energies of the events in this sample were similar.

Even as entanglement gains increasing importance in most\nquantum information processing protocols, its conceptual foundation is still\nwidely debated. Among the open questions are: What is the conceptual meaning of\nquantum entanglement? What are the most general constraints imposed by local\nrealism? Which general quantum states violate these constraints? Developing\nSchroedinger's ideas in an information-theoretic context we suggest that a\nnatural understanding of quantum entanglement results when one accepts (1) that\nthe amount of information per elementary system is finite and (2) that the\ninformation in a composite system resides more in the correlations than in\nproperties of individuals. The quantitative formulation of these ideas leads to\na rather natural criterion of quantum entanglement. Independently, extending\nBell's original ideas, we obtain a single general Bell inequality that\nsummarizes all possible constraints imposed by local realism on the\ncorrelations for a multi-particle system. Violation of the general Bell\ninequality results in an independent general criterion for quantum\nentanglement. Most importantly, the two criteria agree in essence, though the\ntwo approaches are conceptually very different.

It is\nestablished that these properties are closely related by the way, in which\nphotons are detected after a polarizer beam splitter.
