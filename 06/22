To achieve a prompt\nexplosion we have performed a general relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of\nadiabatic collapse and bounce using a relativistic nuclear-matter equation of\nstate. The electron fraction $Y_e$ during the collapse was fixed at the\ninitial-model value. The size of the inner collapsing core was then large\nenough to enable a prompt explosion to occur.

Most of\nthe RRd stars cover the period range of 0.47d < P_0 < 0.49d but there are two\nstars with longer periods of ~0.54d. All variables fit well in the pattern of\nthe P_0 --> P_1/P_0 diagram, spanned by the RRd stars of the Galactic globular\nclusters and those of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). It follows from our\nprevious investigations that the luminosities and masses of the RRd stars in\nGalactic globular clusters and in the LMC are almost independent of\nmetallicity. By assuming that the Sculptor RRd variables also obey this rule,\nwith the aid of the pulsation equations we estimate their metallicities.
