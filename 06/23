We calculate the density spectrum in turbulent magnetized plasmas by\nextending the theory of incompressible MHD turbulence given by Goldreich &\nSridhar to include the effects of compressibility and particle transport. Our\nmost important results are as follows. (1) Density fluctuations are due to the\nslow mode and the entropy mode. Both modes are passively mixed by the cascade\nof shear Alfven waves. Since the shear Alfven waves have a Kolmogorov spectrum,\nso do the density fluctuations. (2) Observed density fluctuation amplitudes\nimply either that the magnetic and gas pressures are comparable, or that the\nouter scale of the turbulence is very small. (3) A high degree of ionization is\nrequired for the cascade to survive damping by neutrals and thereby to extend\nto small lengthscales. Regions that are insufficiently ionized produce density\nfluctuations only on lengthscales larger than the neutral damping scale. These\nregions may account for the excess of power that is found on large scales. (4)\nBoth the entropy mode and the slow mode are damped on lengthscales below that\nat which protons can diffuse across an eddy during the eddy's turnover time.\nConsequently, eddies whose extents along the magnetic field are smaller than\nthe proton collisional mean free path do not contribute to the density\nspectrum. However, in MHD turbulence eddies are highly elongated along the\nmagnetic field. From an observational perspective, the relevant lengthscale is\nthat transverse to the magnetic field.

A New Mathematico- Physical and Information Theoretic\n  Approach","comments":"29 pages, pdf file","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"physics.gen-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  A New Mathematico-Physical and Information Theoretic Approach\n  Examination of the available hard core information to firm up the process of\nunification of quantum and gravitational physics leads to the conclusion that\nfor achieving this synthesis, major paradigm shifts are needed as also the\nanswering of `What is Time?' The object of this submission is to point out the\nmeans of achieving such a grand synthesis. Currently the main pillars\nsupporting the edifice of physics are: (i) The geometrical concepts of space-\ntime-gravitation, (ii) The dynamic concepts involving quantum of action, (iii)\nStatistical thermodynamic concepts, heat and entropy, (iv) Mathematical\nconcepts, tools and techniques serving both as a grand plan and the means of\ncalculation and last but not least v)Controlled observation, pertinent\nexperimentation as the final arbiter. In making major changes the author is\nfollowing Dirac's dictum \"....make changes without sacrificing the existing\nsuperstructure\". It is shown that time can be treated as a parameter rather\nthan an additional dimension. A new entity called \"Ekon\" having the properties\nof both space and momentum is introduced along with a space called\n\"Chalachala\". The requisite connection with Einstein's formulation and\nmathematical aperatus required have been formulated which is highly suited for\nthe purpose. The primacy of the Plancks quantum of action and its\nrepresentation geometrically as a twist is introduced. The practical and\nnumerical estimates have been made and applied to evaluation of the\ngravitational constant in a a seperate submission \"Estimations of gravitational\nconstant from CMBR data\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2001 23:04:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2001 05:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

Our approach suggests an individual asymptotic\ndescription of the quantum subensembles of transmitted and reflected particles\nboth at the final and initial stage of tunneling. We find the initial states of\nboth subensembles, which are non-orthogonal. The latter reflects ultimately the\nfact that at the initial stage of tunneling it is impossible to predict whether\na particle will be transmitted through or reflected off the barrier. At the\nsame time, in this case, one can say about the to-be-transmitted and\nto-be-reflected subensembles of particles. We show that before the interaction\nof the incident packet with the barrier both the number of particles and the\nexpectation value of the particle's momentum are constant for each subensemble.\nBesides, these asymptotic quantities coincide with those of the corresponding\nscattered subensemble. On the basis of this formalism we define individual\ndelay times for both scattering channels. Taking into account the spreading of\nwave packets, we define the low bound of the scattering time to describe the\nwhole quantum ensemble of particles. All three characteristic times are derived\nin terms of the expectation values of the position and momentum operators. The\ncondition which must be fulfilled for completed scattering events is derived.\nWe propose also the scheme of a {\\it gedanken} experiment that allows one to\nverify our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2001 08:51:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2001 04:38:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2001 12:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2002 06:09:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2002 10:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
