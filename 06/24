Star formation can propagate\nradially inwards, due to gravity torques and gas inflow, but also outwards, due\nto superwinds, and energy outflows: both expanding or collapsing waves are\nobserved in circumnuclear regions.

A\nsurvey of the theoretical and experimental literature seeking to quantify the\nimpact of lattice vibrations on phase stability indicates that this effect can\nbe substantial. Typical vibrational entropy differences between phases are of\nthe order of 0.1 to 0.2 k_B/atom, which is comparable to the typical values of\nconfigurational entropy differences in binary alloys (at most 0.693 k_B/atom).\nThis paper describes the basic formalism underlying ab initio phase diagram\ncalculations, along with the generalization required to account for lattice\nvibrations. We overview the various techniques allowing the theoretical\ncalculation and the experimental determination of phonon dispersion curves and\nrelated thermodynamic quantities, such as vibrational entropy or free energy. A\nclear picture of the origin of vibrational entropy differences between phases\nin an alloy system is presented that goes beyond the traditional bond counting\nand volume change arguments. Vibrational entropy change can be attributed to\nthe changes in chemical bond stiffness associated with the changes in bond\nlength that take place during a phase transformation. This so-called ``bond\nstiffness vs. bond length'' interpretation both summarizes the key phenomenon\ndriving vibrational entropy changes and provides a practical tool to model\nthem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2001 02:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Hereby we specifically\napply the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics because of the fact that\nthis formalism allows the description of real contextual influences, i.e. the\ninfluence of the measuring apparatus on the physical entity. We concentrated on\nthe typical situation of the liar paradox and have shown that (1) the\ntruth-false state of this liar paradox can be represented by a quantum vector\nof the non-product type in a finite dimensional complex Hilbert space and the\ndifferent cognitive interactions by the actions of the corresponding quantum\nprojections, (2) the typical oscillations between false and truth - the paradox\n-is now quantum dynamically described by a Schrodinger equation. We analyse\npossible philosophical implications of this result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2001 00:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\nconcentrate mostly on the results of our group FUND at Brussels Free\nUniversity. By means of a spin 1/2 model where the quantum probability is\ngenerated by the presence of fluctuations on the interactions between measuring\napparatus and physical system, we show that the quantum structure can find its\norigin in the presence of these fluctuations. This appraoch, that we have\ncalled the 'hidden measurement approach', makes it possible to construct\nsystems that are in between quantum and classical. We show that two of the\ntraditional axioms of quantum axiomatics are not satisfied for these 'in\nbetween quantum and classical' situations, and how this structural shortcoming\nof standard quantum mechanics is at the origin of most of the quantum\nparadoxes. We show that in this approach the EPR paradox identifies a genuine\nincompleteness of standard quantum mechanics, however not an incompleteness\nthat means the lacking of hidden variables, but an incompleteness pointing at\nthe impossibility for standard quantum mechanics to describe separated quantum\nsystems. We indicate in which way, by redefining the meaning of density states,\nstandard quantum mechanics can be completed. We put forward in which way the\naxiomatic approach to quantum mechanics can be compared to the traditional\naxiomatic approach to relativity theory, and how this might lead to studying\nanother road to unification of both theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2001 02:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper we show that, despite being prescribed by a\nfundamental law, probabilities for individual quantum systems can be understood\nwithin the Bayesian approach. We argue that the distinction between classical\nand quantum probabilities lies not in their definition, but in the nature of\nthe information they encode. In the classical world, maximal information about\na physical system is complete in the sense of providing definite answers for\nall possible questions that can be asked of the system. In the quantum world,\nmaximal information is not complete and cannot be completed. Using this\ndistinction, we show that any Bayesian probability assignment in quantum\nmechanics must have the form of the quantum probability rule, that maximal\ninformation about a quantum system leads to a unique quantum-state assignment,\nand that quantum theory provides a stronger connection between probability and\nmeasured frequency than can be justified classically. Finally we give a\nBayesian formulation of quantum-state tomography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2001 07:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2001 21:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
