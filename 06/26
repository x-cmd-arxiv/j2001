We find that the dynamical\ntime for re-adjustment of the hydrostatic balance is an important relaxation\ntime scale of the problem since it affects evolution of the ionization state of\nthe reflector. Because of this the Fe K-alpha line emissivity depends on the\nshape and intensity of the illuminating flux in prior times, and hence it is\nnot a function of the instantaneous illuminating spectrum.

The energy\ninput to the envelope due to the propeller action by the neutron star exceeds\nthe radiative losses and the plasma temperature in the envelope is of the order\nof the free-fall temperature.

The\nmodel is based on the flaring disk model of Chiang & Goldreich (1997), but with\nthe central regions of the disk removed. The inner rim of the disk is puffed up\nand is much hotter than the rest of the disk, because it is directly exposed to\nthe stellar flux. If located at the dust evaporation radius, its reemitted flux\nproduces a conspicuous bump in the SED which peaks at 2-3 micron. We propose\nthat this emission is the explanation for the near-infrared bump observed in\nthe SEDs of Herbig Ae stars. We study for which stellar parameters this bump\nwould be observable, and find that it is the case for Herbig Ae stellar\nparameters but not for T-Tauri stars, confirming what is found from the\nobservations.

The shadowed region can be quite large, and\nunder some circumstances the entire disk may lie in the shadow. This shadowed\nregion will be much cooler than an unshadowed flaring disk, since its only\nheating sources are radial radiative diffusion and possible indirect sources of\nirradiation. Under certain special circumstances the shadowing effect can\nsuppress, or even completely eliminate, the 10 micron emission feature from the\nspectrum, which might explain the anomalous SEDs of some isolated Herbig Ae\nstars in the sample of Meeus et al.

It appears that all three of these seemingly axiomatic\nfoundational questions have an answer involving an identical physical process:\ninteraction between the electromagnetic quantum vacuum and the fundamental\ncharged particles (quarks and electrons) constituting matter. All three of\nthese effects and equalities can be traced back to the appearance of a specific\nasymmetry in the otherwise uniform and isotropic electromagnetic quantum\nvacuum. This asymmetry gives rise to a non-zero Poynting vector from the\nperspective of an accelerating object. We call the resulting energy-momentum\nflux the {\\it Rindler flux}. The key insight is that the asymmetry in an\naccelerating reference frame in flat spacetime is identical to that in a\nstationary reference frame (one that is not falling) in curved spacetime.\nTherefore the same Rindler flux that creates inertial reaction forces also\ncreates weight. All of this is consistent with the conceptualizaton and\nformalism of general relativity. What this view adds to physics is insight into\na specific physical process creating identical inertial and gravitational\nforces from which springs the weak principle of equivalence. What this view\nhints at in terms of advanced propulsion technology is the possibility that by\nlocally modifying either the electromagnetic quantum vacuum and/or its\ninteraction with matter, inertial and gravitational forces could be modified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2001 19:51:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Five active neutrino oscillation\nsolutions (LMA, LOW, SMA, VAC, and Just So2) are currently allowed at 3 sigma;\nthree sterile neutrino solutions (Just So2, SMA, and VAC) are allowed at 3\nsigma. The goodness of fit is satisfactory for all eight solutions. We also\ninvestigate the robustness of the allowed solutions by carrying out global\nanalyses with and without: 1) imposing solar model constraints on the 8B\nneutrino flux, 2) including the Super-Kamiokande spectral energy distribution\nand day-night data, 3) including a continuous mixture of active and sterile\nneutrinos, 4) using an enhanced CC cross section for deuterium (due to\nradiative corrections), and 5) a optimistic, hypothetical reduction by a factor\nof three of the error of the SNO CC rate. For every analysis strategy used in\nthis paper, the most favored solutions all involve large mixing angles: LMA,\nLOW, or VAC. The favored solutions are robust, but the presence at 3 sigma of\nindividual sterile solutions and the active Just So2 solution is sensitive to\nthe analysis assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2001 21:48:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2001 00:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2001 17:11:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2001 17:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-28"}

The phase transition of a quantum scalar field in a FRW universe\nis analyzed through a first-principles approach in which the dynamics of the\ntwo-point function is derived from the two-loop, two-particle-irreducible\nclosed-time-path effective action. Identifying signatures of correlated domains\nin the infrared portion of the momentum-space power spectrum we find that the\ndomain size scales as a power-law with the expansion rate of the universe. The\nobserved power-law scaling is in good agreement with the predictions of the\nKibble-Zurek mechanism of defect formation and provides evidence of the\nfreeze-out scenario in the context of nonequilibrium quantum field theory. 2).\nThe formation and interaction of topological textures is analyzed in the phase\ntransition of a classical O(3) scalar field theory in 2+1 dimensions. We\nprovide quantiive arguments that by the end of the transition the length scales\nof the texture distribution result from a competition between the length scale\ndetermined at freeze-out and the ordering dynamics of a textured system. 3).

The derivation of these fermionic string properties from bosonic\nconsiderations alone points towards a dynamical origin of the truncation\nprocess. Space-time fermions and supersymmetries would then arise from bosonic\ndegrees of freedom and no fermionic degrees of freedom would be needed in a\nfundamental theory of quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2001 21:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

The\ncrowning derivation is based on information theoretic methods and uses our\nhypothesis that \"particles move via the discrete Bernoulli Process.\" While this\nhypothesis matches special relativity for the mean value of a particle's\nlocation, the variance appears to open the possibility of new physics.\nSpecifically, the variance is dependent on the square of the particle's\nvelocity and since no reference frame is given, we ask if this velocity is\nabsolute and measurable. To answer this question, we conducted an experiment to\nmeasure the jitter on a clock and found a combined 26 sigma three-spike signal\nin the Fourier Transform of the jitter's magnitude. These spikes are predicted\nby the hypothesis since the laboratory's velocity fluctuates due to the Earth\nrevolving and rotating as the solar system moves through the Universe. When\nanalyzing the phase and magnitude, the data suggests the velocity of the\nlaboratory is a validation of the Planck collaboration which measured the same\nvelocity of Earth in the Cosmic Microwave Background reference frame.
