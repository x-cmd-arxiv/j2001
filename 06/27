Many star clusters\nhave been identified not only around several early-type galaxies, but also in\nthe intra-cluster field, as far as 250 kpc from the cluster center. Outside the\nbulges of the central galaxies NGC 3311 and NGC 3309, the intra-cluster\nglobular cluster system is dominated by blue clusters whose spatial\ndistribution is similar to that of the (newly discovered) dwarf galaxies in\nHydra I. The color distributions of globular clusters around NGC 3311 and NGC\n3309 are multimodal, with a sharp blue peak and a slightly broader distribution\nof the red cluster population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2001 08:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The effect is so strong that the tachocline turbulence must\nnot exceed a limit of ~10^-(3...4) of the rms velocity in the convection zone\nin order to let the lithium survive after Gigayears.

Unfortunately, the type\nof the ADM equations is not well understood and therefore we shall discuss, in\nthe next section, the concept of wellposedness. We have to distinguish between\nweakly and strongly hyperbolic systems. Strongly hyperbolic systems are well\nbehaved even if we add lower order terms. In contrast; for every weakly\nhyperbolic system we can find lower order terms which make the problem totally\nillposed. Thus, for weakly hyperbolic systems, there is only a restricted class\nof lower order perturbations which do not destroy the wellposedness. To\nidentify that class can be very difficult, especially for nonlinear\nperturbations. In Section 3 we will show that the ADM equations, linearized\naround flat with constant lapse function and shift vector, are only weakly\nhyperbolic. However, we can use the trace of the metric as a lapse function to\nmake the equations into a strongly second order hyperbolic system. Using simple\nmodels we shall, in section 4, demonstrate that approximations of second order\nequations have better accuracy properties than the corresponding approximations\nof first order equations. Also, we avoid spurious waves which travel against\nthe characteristic direction.

The facility is unique on account of the broadband\ninfrared from the synchrotron, which allows the entire spectral range from 2\ncm-1 (0.25 meV) to 20,000 cm-1 (2.5 eV) to be probed. A temporal resolution of\n200 ps, limited by the infrared synchrotron-pulse duration, is achieved.
