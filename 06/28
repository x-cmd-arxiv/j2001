We present measurements by the Infrared Space\nObservatory Long Wavelength Spectrometer of seven lines from neutral and\nionized ISM of 60 normal, star-forming galaxies. The galaxy sample spans a\nrange in properties such as morphology, FIR colors (indicating dust\ntemperature), and FIR/Blue ratios (indicating star-formation activity and\noptical depth). In two-thirds of the galaxies in this sample, the [CII] line is\nproportional to FIR dust continuum. The other one-third show a smooth decline\nin [CII]/FIR with increasing F60/F100 and FIR/B, spanning a range of a factor\nof more than 50. Two galaxies, at the warm and active extreme of the range have\n[CII]/FIR < 2 \\times 10^{-4} (3-sigma upper limit). This is due to increased\npositive grain charge in the warmer and more active galaxies, which leads to\nless efficient heating by photoelectrons from dust grains. The ratio of the two\nprincipal photodissociation region (PDR) cooling lines [CII]/[OI] shows a tight\ncorrelation with F60/F100, indicating that both gas and dust temperatures\nincrease together. We derive a theoretical scaling between [NII] and [CII] from\nionized gas and use it to separate [CII] emission from neutral PDRs and ionized\ngas. Comparison of PDR models of Kaufman et al. (1999) with observed ratios of\n(a) [OI]/[CII] and ([CII]+[OI])/FIR and (b) [OI]/FIR and F60/F100 yields far-UV\nflux G0 and gas density n. The derived G0 scales as n to the power 1.4. We\ninterpret this correlation as arising from Stromgren sphere scalings if much of\nthe line and continuum luminosity arises near star-forming regions. The\ndifferences in G0 and n may be due to differences in the physical properties of\nthe star-forming clouds.(Short abstract)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2001 18:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Besides\nsurface tension, the viscosity of the fluid is observed to have an effect on\nthe angle of repose and the extent of segregation. In case of bidisperse\nparticles, segregation is observed to decrease and finally saturate depending\non the size ratio of the particles and the viscosity of the fluid. The sharp\ninitial change and the subsequent saturation in the extent of segregation and\nangle of repose occurs over similar volume fraction of the fluid. In the second\nseries of experiments, particles are poured into a container filled with a\nfluid. Although the angle of repose is observed to be unchanged, segregation is\nobserved to decrease with an increase in the viscosity of the fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2001 16:42:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

An angular\ncorrelation function for the two emitted electrons is defined by analogy with\nthe theory of angular correlation in nuclear physics. An expression is obtained\nfor this angular correlation function by a statistical method which makes use\nof the density and efficiency operators. The latter takes care of the\nattenuation of the probability of detection of an electrons due to the\ngeometrical properties of the detector. Theoretical values of the angular\ncorrelation function are obtained for DPI in xenon and these are shown to be in\ngood agreement with the experimental results given by K\\\"{a}mmerling and\nSchmidt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2001 10:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The main\nconclusion is that the Classical Phase Space Transformation can be maintained\nin the operator formalism but the construction of the Quantum Canonical\nTransformation is not clearly related to the Classical Generating Function of a\nClassical Canonical Transformation.
