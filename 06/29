This\napproach allows us to discuss the underlying mechanism, by which d-band\nferromagnetism is influenced by the hybridization on the basis of analytical\nexpressions. The latter clearly display the order and the functional\ndependencies of the important effects. It is found, that spin-dependent\ninter-band particle fluctuations cause a spin-dependent band shift and a\nspin-dependent band broadening of the Hubbard bands. The shift stabilizes, the\nbroadening tends to destabilize ferromagnetism. Stabilization requires\nrelatively high band distances and small hybridization matrix elements.\nSuper-exchange and RKKY coupling are of minor importance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2001 13:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
