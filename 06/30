Even before we are able to work out the details of a\ncomplete theory, however, we do know some important qualitative features to be\nexpected in any quantum theory. Fluctuations of the metric, for example, are\nexpected and are associated with fluctuations of the lightcone. Lightcone\nfluctuations affect the arrival time of signals from distant sources in\npotentially measurable ways, broadening the spectra. In this paper, we start\nwith a thermal spectrum and derive the form of spectral changes expected in a\nwide class of QGTs. We apply these results, valid for any thermal spectrum, to\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB). The CMB offers two advantages: (1)\ndeviations from a thermal spectrum are well constrained, and (2) the radiation\nemanates from the most distant source of light, the surface of last scattering.\nWe use existing CMB data to derive an upper bound on the value of $\\Delta t,$\nthe mean spread in arrival times due to metric fluctuations: ${\\Delta t} < 2.1\n\\times 10^{-14}$ s at the 95% confidence limit.
