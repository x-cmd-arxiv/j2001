This method is valid for samples whose\nmagnetization vector remains perpendicular to the sample surface over a wide\nangle range - which is the case for platelets and thin films - and presents\nseveral advantages over measurements of M_L(H) loops at fixed angles. The\nresulting M_i(\\Theta) curves for several temperatures show a peak in the CD\ndirection at high fields. At lower fields, a very well defined plateau\nindicative of the vortex lock-in to the CD develops. The H dependence of the\nlock-in angle \\phi_L follows the H^{-1} theoretical prediction, while the\ntemperature dependence is in agreement with entropic smearing effects\ncorresponding to short range vortex-defects interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2001 19:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We show that B contains full information about\n(W_k)(c), the k-numerical range of c for each k =1,...,n. We then use our\nprevious work on spectral scales to prove several new facts about (W_k)(c). For\nexample, we show in Theorem 3.4 that the point lambda is a singular point on\nthe boundary of (W_k)(c) if and only if lambda is an isolated extreme point of\n(W_k)(c). In this case lambda = (n/k)tau(cz), where z is a central projection\nin in the algebra generated by b_1, b_2 and the identity. We show in Theorem\n3.5, that c is normal if and only if (W_k)(c) is a polygon for each k.
