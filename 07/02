The stability of the dynamical core is investigated and it is\nshown that this core lacks the well known stability observed in full Kauffman\nnetworks. We conclude that, somewhat counter-intuitive, the remarkable\nstability of Kauffman networks is generated by the dynamics of the stable core.\nThe decimation method is also used to simulate large critical Kauffman\nnetworks. For networks up to N=32 we perform full enumeration studies.

A","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  The temporal evolutions of coherent resonances corresponding to\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and absorption (EIA) were\nobserved in a Hanle absorption experiment carried on the $D_{2}$ lines of $%\n^{87}$Rb vapor by suddenly turning the magnetic field on or off. The main\nfeatures of the experimental observations are well reproduced by a theoretical\nmodel based on Bloch equation where the atomic level degeneracy has been fully\naccounted for. Similar (opposite phase) evolutions were observed at low optical\nfield intensities for Hanle/EIT or Hanle/EIA resonances. Unlike the Hanle/EIA\\\ntransients which are increasingly shorter for driving field intensities\napproaching saturation, the $B\\neq 0$ transient of the Hanle/EIT signal at\nlarge driving field intensities present a long decay time approaching the\natomic transit time. Such counterintuitive behavior is interpreted as a\nconsequence of the Zeno effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2001 15:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
