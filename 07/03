All streets and intersections are treated\nequally, i.e., there are no dominant streets. Starting from a simple\nsynchronized strategy we show that the capacity of the network strongly depends\non the cycle times of the traffic lights. Moreover we point out that the\noptimal time periods are determined by the geometric characteristics of the\nnetwork, i.e., the distance between the intersections. In the case of\nsynchronized traffic lights the derivation of the optimal cycle times in the\nnetwork can be reduced to a simpler problem, the flow optimization of a single\nstreet with one traffic light operating as a bottleneck. In order to obtain an\nenhanced throughput in the model improved global strategies are tested, e.g.,\ngreen wave and random switching strategies, which lead to surprising results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2001 13:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The probability distribution of the return\nvalues of the stocks that are considered by the investor are assumed to be\nknown, while the joint distribution is unknown. The problem is to find the best\ninvestment strategy in order to minimize the probability of losing a certain\npercentage of the invested capital based on different attitudes of the\ninvestors towards future outcomes of the stock market.\n  For portfolios made up of two stocks, this work shows how to exactly and\nquickly solve the problem of finding an optimal portfolio for aggressive or\nrisk-averse investors, using an algorithm based on a fast greedy solution to a\nmaximum flow problem. However, an investor looking for an average-case\nguarantee (so is neither aggressive or risk-averse) must deal with a more\ndifficult problem. In particular, it is #P-complete to compute the distribution\nfunction associated with the average-case bound. On the positive side,\napproximate answers can be computed by using random sampling techniques similar\nto those for high-dimensional volume estimation. When k>2 stocks are\nconsidered, it is proved that a simple solution based on the same flow concepts\nas the 2-stock algorithm would imply that P = NP, so is highly unlikely.

It provides also a natural global reference frame (with\nspace and time coordinates) for the observer, in space-time (or rather in the\npart of it which is causally connected to him), which remains Minkowskian along\nhis world-line. This definition intends to provide a basis for the problem of\nquantization in curved space-time, and/or for non inertial observers.\n  Application to Mikowski space-time illustrates clearly the fact that\ndifferent observers see different spaces. It allows, for instance, to define\nspace everywhere without ambiguity, for the Langevin observer (involved in the\nLangevin pseudoparadox of twins). Applied to the Rindler observer (with uniform\nacceleration) it leads to the Rindler coordinates, whose choice is so justified\nwith a physical basis. This leads to an interpretation of the Unruh effect, as\ndue to the observer's dependence of the definition of space (and time). This\nprescription is also applied in cosmology, for inertial observers in the\nFriedmann - Lemaitre models: space for the observer appears to differ from the\nhypersurfaces of homogeneity, which do not obey the simultaneity requirement.

On the other hand some\nquantum information protocols such as the quantum teleportation and quantum\ndense coding are based on equivalence of some classes of states of bi-partite\nsystems under the action of local (one-particle) unitary operations. In this\npaper we address the question: ``Under what conditions are the two states\nstates, $\\varrho$ and $\\sigma$, of a multi-partite system locally unitary\nequivalent?'' We present a set of conditions which have to be satisfied in\norder that the two states are locally unitary equivalent. In addition, we study\nwhether it is possible to prepare a state of a multi-qudit system. which is\ndivided into two parts A and B, by unitary operations acting only on the\nsystems A and B, separately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2001 15:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
