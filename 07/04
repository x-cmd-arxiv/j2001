Since the SLE solution is known to be thermally unstable,\none might suspect that the new solution would also be unstable.

We analyze the role of\nthermal conduction in both the hot settling flow and the SLE solution. In the\nhot settling flow collisions are very rare.

Rapid and large-amplitude variations seen in the\nX-ray band, on a daily and hourly time-scale, were not detected at optical and\nUV wavelengths, which in turn exhibited much lower variability either on short\n(one day) or long (several months) time-scales. The only significant optical\nvariations can be described as two 2--4 day events with ~10% flux variations.\nWe detect no significant optical line variations and thus cannot infer a\nreverberation size for the broad-line region. Similarly, the large X-ray\nvariations seem to vanish when the light curve is smoothed over a period of 30\ndays. The UV continuum follows the X-rays with a lag of ~0.4 days, and the\noptical band lags the UV band by ~2 days. No significant correlation was found\nbetween the entire X-ray dataset and the optical band. Focusing on a 20-day\ninterval around the strongest optical event we detect a significant\nX-ray--optical correlation with similar events seen in the UV and X-rays.
