There exists no theoretical framework to understand the dynamics\nand conditions under which both these microstructures obtain. Existing theories\nof martensite dynamics describe this transformation in terms of elastic strain,\nwithout any explanation for the occurence of the ferrite.

At low temperatures, the defects\nrelax extremely slowly, forcing a coordinated motion of atoms along specific\ndirections. This results in a twinned critical nucleus which grows rapidly at\nspeeds comparable to that of sound.

This is the regime where\nparticles interact at high energies but with small momentum transfer. We do\nthis for the cases of asymptotically dS and AdS geometries and find that in\nboth cases the theory is topological.

This relativistic analysis connects together hidden momentum in\nmagnets, Solem's strange polarization of the classical hydrogen atom, and the\nAharonov-Bohm Phase shift. We use a relativistic magnetic moment model\nconsisting of many superimposed classical hydrogen atoms interacting through\nthe Darwin Lagrangian with an external charge but not with each other. The\nanalysis of Solem regarding the strange polarization of the classical hydrogen\natom is seen to give a fundamentally different mechanism for the electric field\nof the passing charge to change the magnetic moment. The changing magnetic\nmoment leads to an electric force back at the point charge which i)is second\norder in 1/c, ii)depends upon the magnetic dipole moment, changing sign with\nthe dipole moment, iii)is odd in the charge q of the passing charge, and\niv)reverses sign for charges passing on opposite sides of the magnetic moment.\nWe suggest that a realistic multi-particle magnetic moment involves a changing\nmagnetic moment which keeps the electromagnetic field momentum constant. This\nmeans also that the magnetic moment does not allow a significant shift in its\ninternal center of energy. This criterion also implies that the Lorentz forces\non the charged particle and on the point charge are equal and opposite and that\nthe center of energy of each moves according to Newton's second law where the\nforce is exactly the Lorentz force. Finally, we note that the results and\nsuggestion given here are precisely what are needed to explain both the\nAharonov-Bohm phase shift and the Aharonov-Casher phase shift as arising from\nclassical electromagnetic forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2001 16:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
