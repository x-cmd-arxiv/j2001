In the limit of negligible mass loading a\nsimilarity solution found by Dyson (1973) for expansion into a smooth ambient\nmedium is recovered. The presence of mass loading heats the flow, which leads\nto a reduction in the Mach number of the supersonic freely-expanding flow, and\nweaker jump conditions across the inner shock. In solutions with large mass\nloading, it is possible for the wind to connect directly to the contact\ndiscontinuity without first passing through an inner shock.

Our N-body/SPH\nsimulations suggest a new scenario in which the strong tidal field of M31 can\ntransform a spiral galaxy into a compact elliptical. As a low luminosity spiral\ngalaxy plunges into the central region of M31, most of the outer stellar and\ngaseous components of its disk are dramatically stripped due to M31's tidal\nfield The central bulge component, on the other hand, is just weakly influenced\nby the tidal field owing to its compact configuration, and retains its\nmorphology. M31's strong tidal field also induces rapid gas transfer to the\ncentral region, triggers a nuclear starburst, and consequently forms the\ncentral high density and more metal-rich stellar populations with relatively\nyoung ages. Thus, in this scenario, M32 was previously the bulge of a spiral\ntidally interacting with M31 several Gyr ago. Furthermore, we suggest cEs like\nM32 are rare, the result of both the rather narrow parameter space for tidal\ninteractions which morphologically transform spirals into cEs and the very\nshort time scale ($<$ a few $10^9$ yr) for cEs to be swallowed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2001 03:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Additionally to\nthe results in the papers it contains a detailed introduction and some further\nproofs and remarks. The dissertation gives a description of the topology and\nsymplectic and algebraic geometry of Hitchin's hyperkaehler moduli space M of\nrank 2 Higgs bundles with fixed determinant of odd degree over a fixed Riemann\nsurface. After the long introduction it describes a compactification of M in\ngreat detail, using symplectic cutting (math.AG/9804083). Examining the\ndownward Morse flow of a natural circle action on M it shows the vanishing of\nintersection numbers (math.AG/9805071). Examining the upward Morse flow it\nexplains a set of generators of the cohomology ring and a conjectured explicit\ndescription of the cohomology ring (which was proven in math.AG/0003094). Then\nfinally it introduces the resolution tower for M, and shows that its direct\nlimit is homotopically equivalent with the classifying space of the gauge\ngroup. In turn it yields another proof of the generation theorem (as in\nmath.AG/0003093) and also yields a purely algebraic geometric proof of the\nMumford conjecture about the cohomology ring of the moduli space of rank 2\nstable bundles on curves. It finishes by proving homotopy stabilizations in the\nresolution tower analogously to the Atiyah-Jones conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2001 17:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The parallel\ntempering method was used to overcome convergence difficulties due to\nquasiergodicity in the solid-liquid phase-change regions. All of the clusters\nstudied had pronounced peaks in their heat capacity curves, most of which\ncorresponded to their solid-liquid phase-change regions. The heat capacity peak\nheight and location exhibited two general trends as functions of cluster size:\nfor $N = 25$ to 36, the peak temperature slowly increased, while the peak\nheight slowly decreased, disappearing by $N = 37$; for $N = 30$, a very small\nsecondary peak at very low temperature emerged and quickly increased in size\nand temperature as $N$ increased, becoming the dominant peak by $N = 36$.\nSuperimposed on these general trends were smaller fluctuations in the peak\nheights that corresponded to ``magic number'' behavior, with local maxima found\nat $N = 36, 39, 43, 46$ and 49, and the largest peak found at $N = 55$. These\nmagic numbers were a subset of the magic numbers found for other cluster\nproperties, and can be largely understood in terms of the clusters' underlying\ngeometries. Further insights into the melting behavior of these clusters were\nobtained from quench studies and by examining rms bond length fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2001 05:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
