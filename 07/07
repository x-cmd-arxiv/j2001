The spins interact with their nearest neighbors. We simulate the\ncreation of the long-distance entanglement between remote qubits in the spin\nchain. Our method enables us to minimize unwanted non-resonant effects in a\ncontrolled way. The method we use cannot simulate complicated quantum logic (a\nquantum computer is required to do this), but it can be useful to test the\nexperimental performance of simple quantum logic operations. We show that: (a)\nthe probability distribution of unwanted states has a ``band'' structure, (b)\nthe directions of spins in typical unwanted states are highly correlated, and\n(c) many of the unwanted states are high-energy states of a quantum computer (a\nspin chain). Our approach can be applied to simple quantum logic gates and\nfragments of quantum algorithms involving a large number of qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2001 16:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The cavity non-Hermitean modes (NHM) are\ntreated using the paraxial and monochromaticity approximations. The NHM\nbi-orthogonality relationships are used in a standard canonical quantization\nprocedure based on introducing generalised coordinates and momenta for the\nelectromagnetic (EM) field. The quantum EM field is equivalent to a set of\nquantum harmonic oscillators (QHO), associated with either the cavity or the\nexternal region NHM. This confirms the validity of the photon model in unstable\noptical systems, though the annihilation and creation operators for each QHO\nare not Hermitean adjoints. The quantum Hamiltonian for the EM field is the sum\nof non-commuting cavity and external region contributions, each of which is sum\nof independent QHO Hamiltonians for each NHM, but the external field\nHamiltonian also includes a coupling term responsible for external NHM photon\nexchange processes. Cavity energy gain and loss processes is associated with\nthe non-commutativity of cavity and external region operators, given in terms\nof surface integrals involving cavity and external region NHM functions on the\ncavity-external region boundary. The spontaneous decay of a two-level atom\ninside an unstable cavity is treated using the essential states approach and\nthe rotating wave approximation. Atomic transitions leading to cavity NHM\nphoton absorption have a different coupling constant to those leading to photon\nemission, a feature resulting from the use of NHM functions.

Our way is\ncompletely different from so-called hidden parameter models, namely, we start\nfrom a certain variant of QM - deterministic QM - which has most features\nsimilar to QM, but the evolution in this theory is deterministic. Then we\nintroduce the subquantum medium composed of so-called space-like objects. The\ninteraction of a deterministic QM-particle with this medium is represented by\nthe random force, but it is the random force governed by the probability\namplitude distribution. This is the quantum random force and it is very\ndifferent from classical random force. This implies that in our models there\nare no Bell`s inequalities and that our models (depending on a certain\nparameter tau) can be arbitrarily close to QM. The parameter tau defines a\nrelaxation time and on time intervals shorter than tau, the evolution violates\nHeisenberg`s uncertainty principle and it is almost deterministic - spreading\nof the wave packet is much slower than in QM. Such type of short-time effects\nform the bases of proposed tests, which can, in principle, define limits of\nvalidity of QM. The proposed experiments are related to the behavior of quantum\nobjects on short time intervals, where we expect the behavior different from\nQM. The main proposed feature is violation of uncertainty relations on short\ntime intervals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2001 19:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Nonetheless, there can be non-trivial upper bounds on both Bob's\nprobability of correctly estimating Alice's commitment and Alice's probability\nof successfully unveiling whatever bit she desires. In this paper, we seek to\ndetermine these bounds for generalizations of the BB84 bit commitment protocol.\nIn such protocols, an honest Alice commits to a bit by randomly choosing a\nstate from a specified set and submitting this to Bob, and later unveils the\nbit to Bob by announcing the chosen state, at which point Bob measures the\nprojector onto the state. Bob's optimal cheating strategy can be easily deduced\nfrom well known results in the theory of quantum state estimation. We show how\nto understand Alice's most general cheating strategy, (which involves her\nsubmitting to Bob one half of an entangled state) in terms of a theorem of\nHughston, Jozsa and Wootters. We also show how the problem of optimizing\nAlice's cheating strategy for a fixed submitted state can be mapped onto a\nproblem of state estimation. Finally, using the Bloch ball representation of\nqubit states, we identify the optimal coherent attack for a class of protocols\nthat can be implemented with just a single qubit. These results provide a tight\nupper bound on Alice's probability of successfully unveiling whatever bit she\ndesires in the protocol proposed by Aharonov et al., and lead us to identify a\nqubit protocol with even greater security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2001 22:15:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2002 20:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
