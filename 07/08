This incompleteness is however not due to\nthe absence of hidden variables but to the impossibility for standard quantum\nmechanics to describe separated quantum entities. Nonlocality appears as a\ngenuine property of nature in our view and makes it necessary to reconsider the\nrole of space in reality. Our proposal for a new interpretation for space makes\nit possible to put forward an new hypothesis for why it has not been possible\nto unify quantum mechanics and relativity theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2001 17:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
