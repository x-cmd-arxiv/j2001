Applying an inhomogeneous chemical evolution model to our\nGalaxy reveals a number of shortcomings of existing theoretical nucleosynthesis\nyields. One problem is the predicted scatter in [O/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] which is too\nlarge compared to the one observed in metal-poor halo stars. This can be either\ndue to the O or Mg yields or due to the Fe yields (or both). However, O and Mg\nare alpha-elements that are produced mainly during hydrostatic burning and thus\nare not affected by the theoretical uncertainties afflicting the collapse and\nexplosion of a massive star. Stellar iron yields, on the other hand, depend\nheavily on the choice of the mass-cut between ejecta and proto neutron star and\nare therefore very uncertain. We present Fe yield distributions as function of\nprogenitor mass that are consistent with the abundance distribution of metal-\npoor halo stars and are in agreement with observed Ni yields of SNe II with\nknown progenitor masses. The iron yields of lower-mass SNe II (in the range\n10-20 Msol) are well constrained by those observations. Present observations,\nhowever, do not allow to determine a unique solution for higher-mass SNe.\nNevertheless, the main dependence of the stellar iron yield as function of\nprogenitor mass may be derived and can be used as constraint for future\nsupernova/hypernova models.

We assume that the random electric field acting on a test\ncharged particle is isotropic and possesses non-Gaussian Levy stable\nstatistics. These assumptions provide us with a straightforward possibility to\nconsider formation of anomalous stationary states and superdiffusion processes,\nboth properties are inherent to strongly non-equilibrium plasmas of solar\nsystems and thermonuclear devices. We solve fractional kinetic equations, study\nthe properties of the solution, and compare analytical results with those of\nnumerical simulation based on the solution of the Langevin equations with the\nnoise source having Levy stable probability density. We found, in particular,\nthat the stationary states are essentially non-Maxwellian ones and, at the\ndiffusion stage of relaxation, the characteristic displacement of a particle\ngrows superdiffusively with time and is inversely proportional to the magnetic\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2001 07:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Friedman et al.,Nature, 406 (2000) 43]. To face the\nchallenge of this new fact, in this article QM in its standard form is assumed\nto be extended by one beable (hidden variable), i. e., a quantum observable\nwith always definite values in nature (but usually only statistically given in\nthe quantum state). Localization is taken as the most plausible beable. The\nparadoxical aspects of conventional QM take now a different form. Suitably\ndefining the notion of \"subject\" fully within the QM formalism, proving the\nquantum conditional subsystem-state theorem, and choosing the\nrelative-decoherence interpretation of QM, the paradoxes formally disappear,\nleaving one with decoherence relative to the definite values of the beable;\nthus being only appearance, not absolute reality in QM. Relative to a different\nsubject one has perseverance of coherence. Hence, in this approach it is\nclaimed that decoherence and coherence, both exist in reality, but are not\n\"seen\" by the same subject, and \"subject\" is, in this interpretation,\nindispensable. The two mentioned, apparently contradictory phenomena, are in\nthis way decoupled from each other, contradiction is avoided, and any one of\nthe two can be treated in the way that is usual in QM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2001 10:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
