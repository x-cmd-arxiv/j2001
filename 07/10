We present the analysis of the spectroscopic catalog of galaxies in\nthe Coma cluster from Mobasher et al. This catalog comprises ~300 spectra of\ncluster members with magnitudes M_B=-20.5 to -14 in two areas of ~1 X 1.5 Mpc\ntowards the center and the SW region of the cluster. In this paper the analysis\nis restricted to the 257 galaxies with no emission lines in their spectra. The\nstrength of the age-sensitive indices is found to correlate with galaxy\nmagnitude over the whole magnitude range. Similarly, the metallicity-sensitive\nindices anticorrelate with magnitude. By comparing the observed indices with\nmodel grids based on the Padova isochrones, we derive luminosity-weighted ages\nand metallicities. We present the distributions of ages and metallicities for\ngalaxies in various magnitude bins. The mean metallicity decreases with galaxy\nmagnitude and, at a given luminosity, appears to be generally lower for\ngalaxies in the SW region of Coma as compared to the center of the cluster. A\nbroad range of ages, from younger than 3 Gyr to older than 9 Gyr, is found in\ngalaxies of any magnitude. However, systematic trends of age with luminosity\nare present among galaxies in the central field. In the central Mpc of Coma, a\nlarge fraction of galaxies at any luminosity (50-60% of the giants, >30 % of\nthe dwarfs) show no evidence in their central regions of star formation\noccurred at redshift z<2, while the proportion of galaxies with significant\nstar formation occurring at intermediate (0.35<z<2) and low (z<0.35) redshifts\nis found to depend on galaxy luminosity. Faint galaxies with young\nluminosity-weighted ages appear to have a bimodal metallicity distribution\nthat, if confirmed, would point to a composite formation scenario. Finally, we\npresent an interpretation of the index-magnitude relations observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2001 16:50:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2001 08:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We find that the central He burning is only marginally affected by\na change in this cross section within the currently accepted uncertainty range.\nThe only (important) quantity which varies significantly is the amount of C\nleft by the He burning. Since the C(alpha,gamma)16O is efficient in a\nconvective core, we have also analyzed the influence of the convective mixing\nin determining the final C abundance left by the central He burning. Our main\nfinding is that the adopted mixing scheme does not influence the final C\nabundance provided the outer border of the convective core remains essentially\nfixed (in mass) when the central He abundance drops below about 0.1 dex by mass\nfraction; vice versa, even a slight shift (in mass) of the border of the\nconvective core during the last part of the central He burning could\nappreciably alter the final C abundance.

The local path integral measure and Lorentz invariant local\nLagrangian, when combined with Green's functions defined in terms of time\nordered products, ensure causality regardless of statistics. The Feynman's\n$m-i\\epsilon$ prescription ensures the positive energy condition regardless of\nstatistics, and the abnormal spin-statistics relation for both of spin-0 scalar\nparticles and spin-1/2 Dirac particles is excluded if one imposes the positive\nnorm condition in conjunction with Schwinger's action principle. The minus\ncommutation relation between one Bose and one Fermi field arises naturally in\npath integral. The Feynman's $m-i\\epsilon$ prescription also ensures a smooth\ncontinuation to Euclidean theory, for which the use of the Weyl anomaly is\nillustrated to exclude the abnormal statistics for the scalar and Dirac\nparticles not only in 4-dimensional theory but also in 2-dimensional theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2001 07:53:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2001 06:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Their\ndynamic coupling is allowed in the near field, that is, for frequencies roughly\nbelow ~c/r for virtual exchanges between two elementary entities. It is also\nvalid for tunneling photons from very distant and red-shifted matter in the\nradiation gauge. In this case, the near magnetic field can be safely ignored. I\ntreat the problem using Planck's and Post's ensemble description of harmonic\noscillators. It is found that the correlated interacting modes have lower eigen\nfrequencies and positive zero-modes, their anticorrelating counterparts having\nhigher eigenfrequencies and negative zero-modes. While the former tend to\ninduce coherent states over large ensembles, the latter cannot. This applies to\nall the modes of the near field, as well as to the transverse radiant modes. As\na result, an attractive -1/r long-range potential is found in all the\nzero-modes of the near field, with a cosmological constant depending on the\ndisorder in the system, provided that the interacting modes be most strongly\ncohered from the far infrared. This occurs naturally in Yilmaz's cosmology,\nwhere the Zitterbewegung of very distant matter is felt in the far infrared by\nthe Zitterbewegung of local matter, in proportion to the frequencies of both,\nwhich agrees with the principle of equivalence. The Machian inertia appears on\ncosmic scales from bound coherent states through this tunneling electromagnetic\nradiation. In an elliptic Universe, the very low frequency modes of the coupled\noscillators can be identified with those of their radiative antipodal image.

Therefore classical mechanics can be viewed as\na crisp limit of a \"fuzzy\" quantum mechanics. Based on these considerations it\nis possible to arrive at the Schroedinger equation directly from the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation. The link between these equations is based on the fact\nthat a unique (\"crisp\") trajectory of a classical particle emerges out of a\ncontinuum of possible paths collapsing to a single trajectory according to the\nprinciple of least action. This can be interpreted as a consequence of an\nassumption that a quantum \"particle\" \"resides\" in every path of the continuum\nof paths which collapse to a single(unique) trajectory of an observed classical\nmotion. A wave function then is treated as a function describing a\ndeterministic entity having a fuzzy character. As a consequence of such an\ninterpretation, the complimentarity principle and wave-particle duality can be\nabandoned in favor of a fuzzy deterministic microoobject.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2001 23:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
