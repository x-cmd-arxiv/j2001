A two-fluid model is used to describe the matter, where one fluid is the\nsuperfluid neutrons that are believed to exist in the inner crust and core of\nmature neutron stars, while the other fluid is a charge neutral conglomerate of\nthe remaining constituents (crust nuclei, core superconducting protons,\nelectrons, etc). We include the entrainment effect, which is a non-dissipative\ninteraction between the two fluids whereby a momentum induced in one of the\nfluids will cause part of the mass of the other fluid to be carried along. The\nequations that describe rotational equilibria (i.e. axisymmetric and stationary\nconfigurations) are approximated using the slow-rotation approximation; an\nexpansion in terms of the rotation rates of the two fluids where only terms up\nto second-order are kept. Our formalism allows the neutrons to rotate at a rate\ndifferent from that of the charged constituents. For a particular equation of\nstate that is quadratic in the two mass-densities and relative velocities of\nthe fluids, we find an analytic solution to the slow-rotation equations. This\nresult provides an elegant generalisation to the two-fluid problem of the\nstandard expressions for the one-fluid polytrope ${\\cal E} \\propto \\rho^2$. The\nmodel equation of state includes entrainment and is general enough to allow for\nrealistic values for, say, mass and radius of the star. It also includes a term\nthat can be related to ``symmetry energy'' terms that appear in more realistic\nequations of state. We use the analytic solution to explore how relative\nrotation between the two fluids, the ``symmetry energy'' term, and entrainment\naffect the neutron star's local distribution of particles, as well as global\nquantities as the Kepler limit, ellipticity, and moments of inertia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2001 16:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Traditionally, the continuum is\nobtained by a polynomial fitting truncating it at a lower order, and the mean\ntransmission is calculated over the entire wavelength range considered. The\nflux F is then normalized by the average of Fc e^{-tau}. However, the\nfluctuations in the transmitted flux are significantly correlated with the\nlocal background flux on scales for which the field is intermittent. In this\npaper, we develop a self-normalization algorithm of the transmission power\nspectrum based on a multiresolution analysis. This self-normalized power\nspectrum estimator needs neither a continuum fitting, nor pre-determining the\nmean transmission. With simulated samples, we show that the self-normalization\nalgorithm can perfectly recover the transmission power spectrum from the flux\nregardless of how the continuum varies with wavelength. We also show that the\nself-normalized power spectrum is also properly normalized by the mean\ntransmission. Moreover, this power spectrum estimator is sensitive to the\nnon-linear behavior of the field. That is, the self-normalized power spectrum\nestimator can distinguish between fields with or without the\nfluctuation-background correlation. This cannot be accomplished by the power\nspectrum with the normalization by an overall mean transmission. Therefore, the\nself-normalized power spectrum would be useful for the discrimination among\nmodels without the uncertainties caused by free (or fitting) parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2001 19:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

First, a two-replica calculation is performed. By mapping\nthe two-replica problem to the denaturation of a single homogeneous RNA in\n6-dimensional embedding space, we show that sequence disorder is perturbatively\nirrelevant, i.e., an RNA molecule with weak sequence disorder is in a molten\nphase where many secondary structures with comparable total energy coexist. A\nnumerical study of various models at high temperature reproduces behaviors\ncharacteristic of the molten phase. On the other hand, a scaling argument based\non the extremal statistics of rare regions can be constructed to show that the\nlow temperature phase is unstable to sequence disorder. We performed a detailed\nnumerical study of the low temperature phase using the droplet theory as a\nguide, and characterized the statistics of large-scale, low-energy excitations\nof the secondary structures from the ground state structure. We find the\nexcitation energy to grow very slowly (i.e., logarithmically) with the length\nscale of the excitation, suggesting the existence of a marginal glass phase.\nThe transition between the low temperature glass phase and the high temperature\nmolten phase is also characterized numerically. It is revealed by a change in\nthe coefficient of the logarithmic excitation energy, from being disorder\ndominated to entropy dominated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2001 21:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This chiral quark model satisfies the\nlow energy theorems. Using the vacuum masses and decay widths of \\pi- and\n\\rho-mesons for fixing the model parameters, the properties of the \\sigma-\nmeson are derived. Within the Matsubara formalism, the model is systematically\nextended to finite temperatures where chiral symmetry restoration due to a\ndropping constituent quark mass entails a vanishing of the infrared cut-off\n(deconfinement) at the pion Mott temperature T_c=186 MeV. Besides of the pion\nmass and weak decay constant, the masses, coupling constants and decay widths\nof \\sigma- and \\rho-mesons in hot matter are investigated. The quark-antiquark\ndecay channel of the light mesons is opened for T>T_c only and becomes\nparticularly strong for the \\rho- meson. The two-pion decay channel below T_c\nhas almost constant width for the \\rho- meson up to T_c, but for the\n\\sigma-meson it closes below T_c such that a scalar meson state with vanishing\nwidth is obtained as a precursor of the chiral/deconfinement transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2001 13:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
