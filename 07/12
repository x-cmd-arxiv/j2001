The luminosity of the source\n(in the 0.1-100 keV band) ranges from $2.5 \\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the\nperiastron (orbital phase 0.01) to $1.5 \\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at orbital\nphase 0.3. From the spectral analysis and the lightcurve we argue that Cir X-1\nshows three states along the orbital evolution. The first state is at the\norbital phase interval 0.97-0.3: the luminosity becames super-Eddington and a\nstrong flaring activity is present. In this state a shock could form in the\ninner region of the system due to the super-Eddington accretion rate, producing\nan outflow of ionized matter whose observational signature could be the\nprominent absorption edge at $\\sim 8.7$ keV observed in the energy spectrum at\nthese phases. In the second state, corresponding to the orbital phase interval\nbetween 0.3 and 0.7, the accretion rate is sub-Eddington and we observe a\nweaker outflow, with smaller hydrogen column: the absorption edge is now at\n$\\sim 8.3$ keV with an optical depth a factor of 2.5 to 6 smaller. The third\nstate corresponds to the orbital phase interval 0.78-0.97. In this state the\nbest fit model to the spectrum requires the presence of a partial covering\ncomponent, indicating that the emission from the compact object is partially\nabsorbed by neutral matter, probably the atmosphere of the companion star\nand/or the accreting matter from the companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2001 16:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Two types of potentials produced by various\nmultiphoton Raman processes in a high-finesse cavity are examined. As an\napplication the deflection of dressed atomic wave by a cavity mode is\ninvestigated. New momentum distribution of the atoms is derived that depends\nfrom the parameters of coherent field as well as photon states in the cavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2001 07:14:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2001 08:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Two bits of classical information are encoded\non two quadratures of a half of bright EPR beam at the sender Alice and\ntransmitted to the receiver Bob via one qubit of the shared quantum state after\nencoding. The amplitude and phase signals are simultaneously decoded with the\nother half of EPR beam by the direct measurement of the Bell-state at Bob. The\nsignal to noise ratios of the simultaneously measured amplitude and phase\nsignals are improved 5.4dB and 4.8dB with respect to that of the shot noise\nlimit respectively. A high degree of immunity to unauthorized eavesdropping of\nthe presented quantum communication scheme is experimentally demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2001 10:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
