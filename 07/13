This led to the discovery of a dramatic luminosity\nvariation from ~2x10^34 erg/s to ~5x10^36 erg/s (factor ~250) in less than 15\nhr. The variation was accompanied by only minor (if any) changes in the emitted\nspectrum and pulse fraction. On the contrary an observation near apastron\ndetected the source in a nearly constant state at a level of ~2x10^33 erg/s.\nDirect accretion onto the neutron star surface encounters major difficulties in\nexplaining the source variability properties. When the different regimes\nexpected for a rotating magnetic neutron star subject to a variable inflow of\nmatter from its companion are taken into consideration, the results of BeppoSAX\nobservations of 4U 0115+63 can be explained naturally. In particular close to\napastron, the regime of centrifugal inhibition of accretion applies, whereas\nthe dramatic source flux variability observed close to periastron is readily\ninterpreted as the transition regime between direct neutron star accretion and\nthe propeller regime. In this centrifugal transition regime small variations of\nthe mass inflow rate give rise to very large luminosity variations. We present\na simple model for this transition, which we successfully apply to the X-ray\nflux and pulse fraction variations measured by BeppoSAX.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2001 08:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Radial orbits within the Virgo cluster's gravitational\npotential are modeled and analyzed with respect to ram pressure stripping. The\nN-body model consists of 10000 gas cloud complexes which can have inelastic\ncollisions. Ram pressure is modeled as an additional acceleration on the clouds\nlocated at the surface of the gas distribution in the direction of the galaxy's\nmotion within the cluster. We made several simulations changing the orbital\nparameters in order to recover different stripping scenarios using realistic\ntemporal ram pressure profiles. We investigate systematically the influence of\nthe inclination angle between the disk and the orbital plane of the galaxy on\nthe gas dynamics. We show that ram pressure can lead to a temporary increase of\nthe central gas surface density. In some cases a considerable part of the total\natomic gas mass (several 10^8 M_solar) can fall back onto the galactic disk\nafter the stripping event. A quantitative relation between the orbit parameters\nand the resulting HI deficiency is derived containing explicitly the\ninclination angle between the disk and the orbital plane. The comparison\nbetween existing HI observations and the results of our simulations shows that\nthe HI deficiency depends strongly on galaxy orbits.

The present theory incorporates the\nMott-Hubbard, Brinkman-Rice and Slater pictures of the MIT into a unified\nframework, together with reproducing low-energy narrow band arising from\nspin-charge fluctuations. At half filling, single-particle spectra $A(\\omega,\nk)$ show formation of two Hubbard bands and their antiferromagnetic shadows\nseparated by a Mott gap in the plane of energy $\\omega$ and momentum $k$ with\nlowering temperatures. These four bands produce splitting to two low-energy\nnarrow bands and two SDW-like bands in the dispersion. Near half filling, the\nlow-energy narrow band persists at low temperatures. This narrow band has a\nparticularly weak dispersion and large weights around $(\\pi, 0)$ and $(0, \\pi)$\nmomenta.

The covalent one-electron $\\sigma$\nbonding gives rise to a strongly correlated state of electrons resulting from\nthe exchange interaction between electrons when they are simultaneously at\ncation and anion orbitals. The manifestation of the correlatred state is the\nspin and spatial ordering of the electrons resulting in the formation of a\nspin- ordered electron lattice. The conductivity of manganites in this model is\nthe consequence of displacement of the electron lattice (or its part) from one\nlocalization site to another and depends on the type of spin ordering of the\nelectrons in the electron lattice and the localization energy determined by the\nenergy of the one-electron $\\sigma$ bond. The model also assumes a strong\npolarization of an anion by cations, which facilitates the 3s2p hybridization\nof the anion and transition of one of the pairs of 2p electrons from the\nsinglet state into the triplet state. This transition leads to formation of the\nspin-polarized electron lattice (electron spins are parallel) and ferromagnetic\nordering of manganese ions.

With the proton\ndensity distribution thus obtained, the charge-changing cross sections for C,\nN, O and F isotopes are calculated using the Glauber model. Good agreement with\nthe data has been achieved. The charge changing cross sections change only\nslightly with the neutron number except for proton-rich nuclei. Similar trends\nof variations of proton radii and of charge changing cross sections for each\nisotope chain is observed which implies that the proton density plays important\nrole in determining the charge-changing cross sections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2001 01:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The addition of the Lorentz force is mainly felt\nin the short range and suppresses the radial correlated oscillating mode of\nsuch coupled oscillators. This imposes constraints on the system that make the\ntwo transverse modes degenerate. As a result, an 1/r antigravitational\ninteraction now appears in the surviving anticorrelated radial zero-mode, which\ndoes not allow coherent states to form. As gravitation can only emerge from\ncoherent modes, it can no longer be transitive.
