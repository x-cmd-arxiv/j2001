In the context of this model, we show that the data constrain the\nelectron antineutrino rest mass to be less than 5.7 eV with 95% probability.\nOur analysis takes advantage of significant advances that have occured in the\nyears since the detections in both our understanding of the supernova mechanism\nand our ability to analyze sparse data.

We find\nthat two-component models for the neutrino signal make the data >100 times more\nprobable than single-component models. In addition, the radius and binding\nenergy of the nascent neutron star implied by single-component models deviates\nsignificantly from the values predicted by current neutron star models, whereas\nthose implied by models with an accretion component are in complete agreement\nwith the predictions.
