Specifically, a\nmethod is described which allows the probabilities with which the metastable\nstates are occupied to be calculated by finding optimal paths, and fluctuations\nabout them, in the weak noise limit. The method is illustrated on a system\ndescribed by two coupled Langevin equations, which are found in the study of\ninstabilities in fluid dynamics and superconductivity. The problem involves a\nsubtle interplay between non-linearities and noise, and a naive approximation\nscheme which does not take this into account is shown to be unsatisfactory. The\nuse of optimal paths is briefly reviewed and then applied to finding the\nconditional probability of ending up in one of the metastable states, having\nbegun in the unstable state. There are several aspects of the calculation which\ndistinguish it from most others involving optimal paths: (i) the paths do not\nbegin and end on an attractor, and moreover, the final point is to a large\nextent arbitrary, (ii) the interplay between the fluctuations and the leading\norder contribution are at the heart of the method, and (iii) the final result\ninvolves quantities which are not exponentially small in the noise strength.\nThis final result, which gives the probability of a particular state being\nselected in terms of the parameters of the dynamics, is remarkably simple and\nagrees well with the results of numerical simulations. The method should be\napplicable to similar problems in a number of other areas such as state\nselection in lasers, activationless chemical reactions and population dynamics\nin fluctuating environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2001 21:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We derive the general transformation law, describing\nthe change in the self force in terms of the infinitesimal displacement vector\nassociated with the gauge transformation. Based on this transformation law, we\nextend the regularization prescription by Mino et al. and Quinn and Wald\n(originally formulated within the harmonic gauge) to an arbitrary gauge. Then\nwe extend the method of mode-sum regularization (which provides a practical\nmeans for calculating the regularized self force and was recently applied to\nthe harmonic-gauge gravitational self force) to an arbitrary gauge. We find\nthat the regularization parameters involved in this method are\ngauge-independent. We also explore the gauge transformation of the self force\nfrom the harmonic gauge to the Regge-Wheeler gauge and to the radiation gauge,\nfocusing attention on the regularity of these gauge transformations. We\nconclude that the transformation of the self force to the Regge-Wheeler gauge\nin Schwarzschild spacetime is regular for radial orbits and irregular\notherwise, whereas the transformation to the radiation gauge is irregular for\nall orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2001 13:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
