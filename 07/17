With\nplausible choices for SED parameters (e.g., T=35 K, beta=1.0), the simulation\npredictions reproduce the observed number counts above ~ 1 mJy. The sources\nhave a broad redshift distribution with median z ~ 2, in reasonable agreement\nwith observational constraints. However, the predicted count distribution may\nbe too steep at the faint end, and the fraction of low redshift objects may be\nlarger than observed.\n  In this physical model of the sub-mm galaxy population, the objects detected\nin existing surveys consist mainly of massive galaxies (several M_*) forming\nstars fairly steadily over timescales ~ 10^8-10^9 years, at moderate rates ~100\nMsun/yr. The typical descendants of these sub-mm sources are even more massive\ngalaxies, with old stellar populations, found primarily in dense environments.\nWhile the resolution of our simulations is not sufficient to determine galaxy\nmorphologies, these properties support the proposed identification of sub-mm\nsources with massive ellipticals in the process of formation.

We\ndemonstrate the existence of a galaxy proximity effect, in that galaxies in the\nvicinities of QSOs do not show the same incidence and extent of gaseous\nenvelopes as galaxies far from QSOs. We show that the galaxy proximity effect\nexists to galaxy-QSO velocity separations of ~ 3000 km/s, much larger than the\nsize of a typical cluster (~ 1000 km/s), i.e. it is more comparable to the\nscale of the sphere of influence of QSO ionizing radiation rather than the\nscale of galaxy-QSO clustering. This indicates that the QSO ionizing radiation\nrather than some dynamical effect from the cluster environment is responsible\nfor the galaxy proximity effect. We combine previous findings that (1) many or\nmost Lya absorption lines arise in extended galaxy envelopes, and (2) galaxies\ncluster around QSOs to show that the magnitude of the Lya forest proximity\neffect is underestimated. Consequently, determinations of the UV ionizing\nbackground intensity using the proximity effect are likely overestimated. We\nuse the galaxy-QSO cross-correlation function measured from our data to\nestimate the magnitude of this overestimate and find that it could be as high\nas a factor of 20 at z<1. This can have strong implications for models of the\norigin and evolution of the ionizing background, and may indicate that QSOs\nproduce sufficient ionizing flux at all redshifts to account for the entire\nbackground radiation field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2001 23:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Our calculations\ninclude evaporation by two-body relaxation and gravitational shocks and mass\nloss by stellar evolution. We find that, for a wide variety of initial\nconditions, the mass function develops a turnover or peak and that, after 12\nGyr, this is remarkably close to the observed peak for globular clusters, at\nM_p = 2 10^5 solar masses. Below the peak, the evolution is dominated by\ntwo-body relaxation, and the mass function always develops a tail of the form\npsi(M) = const, reflecting that the masses of tidally limited clusters decrease\nlinearly with time just before they are destroyed. This also agrees well with\nthe empirical mass function of globular clusters in the Milky Way. Above the\npeak, the evolution is dominated by stellar evolution at early times and\ngravitational shocks at late times. These processes shift the mass function to\nlower masses while nearly preserving its shape. The radial variation of the\nmass function within a galaxy depends on the initial position-velocity\ndistribution of the clusters. We find that some radial anisotropy in the\ninitial velocity distribution, especially when this increases outward, is\nneeded to account for the observed near-uniformity of the mass functions of\nglobular clusters. This may be consistent with the observed near-isotropy of\nthe present velocity distributions because clusters on elongated orbits are\npreferentially destroyed. These results are based on models with static,\nspherical galactic potentials. We point out that there would be even more\nradial mixing of the orbits and hence more uniformity of the mass function if\nthe galactic potentials were time-dependent and/or non-spherical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2001 06:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2001 04:23:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2001 19:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Superconductivity arises when they are properly doped away from\nstoichiometry1. In Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, superconductivity results from doping with\nexcess oxygen atoms, which introduce positive charge carriers (holes) into the\nCuO2 planes, where superconductivity is believed to originate. The role of\nthese oxygen dopants is not well understood, other than the fact that they\nprovide charge carriers. However, it is not even clear how these charges\ndistribute in the CuO2 planes. Accordingly, many models of high-Tc\nsuperconductors simply assume that the charge carriers introduced by doping\ndistribute uniformly, leading to an electronically homogeneous system, as in\nordinary metals. Here we report the observation of an electronic inhomogeneity\nin the high-Tc superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x using scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy.

We reexamine this PQCD deep problem. By including NLO power\ncorrections to the pion form factor, we may arrive at a perturbative\nexplanation for the data. The key realization is that we need to interprete\nthat the strong interaction coupling constant involved in the PQCD result\nshould be taken as an effective coupling constant under nonperturbative QCD\nvaccum. This implies that one can equally identify the relevant scale for the\neffective coupling constant as the factorization scale about 1 GeV.

The fundamental analogy stems from the behavior\nof quantum entanglement under local operations and classical communication and\nthe behavior of secret correlations under local operations and public\ncommunication. A large number of derived analogies follow. In particular\nteleportation is analogous to the one-time-pad, the concept of ``pure state''\nexists in the classical domain, entanglement concentration and dilution are\nessentially classical secrecy protocols, and single copy entanglement\nmanipulations have such a close classical analog that the majorization results\nare reproduced in the classical setting. This analogy allows one to import\nquestions from the quantum domain into the classical one, and vice-versa,\nhelping to get a better understanding of both. Also, by identifying classical\naspects of quantum entanglement it allows one to identify those aspects of\nentanglement which are uniquely quantum mechanical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2001 18:38:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2001 12:06:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2001 11:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

This yields a pure, non-local spin-singlet state at\nthe output leads. Coulomb interaction is the nonlinearity essential for\nentanglement generation, and, in its absence, the singlet state vanishes.
