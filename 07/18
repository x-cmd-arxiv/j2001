The most direct test of this hypothesis\nconsists in testing Gaussianity of the CMB maps. Counting the pixels with the\ntemperatures in given ranges and thus estimating the one point probability\nfunction of the field is the simplest of all the tests. Other usually more\ncomplex tests of Gaussianity generally use a great deal of the information\nalready contained in the probability function. However, the most interesting\noutcome of such a test would be the signal of non-Gaussianity independent of\nthe probability function. It is shown that the independent information has\npurely morphological character i.e. it depends on the geometry and topology of\nthe level contours only. As an example we discuss in detail the quadratic model\n$v=u+\\alpha (u^2-1)$ ($u$ is a Gaussian field with $\\bar{u}=0$ and $<u^2>=1$,\n$\\alpha$ is a parameter) which may arise in slow-roll or two-field inflation\nmodels.

A novel intermediate regime between the Fermi system of weakly\ninteracting localized particles and the correlated Wigner solid is obtained. A\ndetailed analysis of the non disordered case shows that the intermediate ground\nstate is a solid entangled with an excited liquid. For electrons in two\ndimensions, this raises the question of the existence of an unnoticed\nintermediate liquid-solid phase.

The main tool\nwe use is the \\textit{schematization functor} $X \\mapsto (X\\otimes\n\\mathbb{C})^{sch}$, introduced by the third author as a substitute for the\nrationalization functor in homotopy theory in the case of non-simply connected\nspaces. Our main result is the construction of a \\textit{Hodge decomposition}\non $(X\\otimes\\mathbb{C})^{sch}$. This Hodge decomposition is encoded in an\naction of the discrete group $\\mathbb{C}^{\\times \\delta}$ on the object\n$(X\\otimes \\mathbb{C})^{sch}$ and is shown to recover the usual Hodge\ndecomposition on cohomology, the Hodge filtration on the pro-algebraic\nfundamental group as defined by C.Simpson, and in the simply connected case,\nthe Hodge decomposition on the complexified homotopy groups as defined by\nJ.Morgan and R. Hain. This Hodge decomposition is shown to satisfy a purity\nproperty with respect to a weight filtration, generalizing the fact that the\nhigher homotopy groups of a simply connected projective manifold have natural\nmixed Hodge structures. As a first application we construct a new family of\nexamples of homotopy types which are not realizable as complex projective\nmanifolds. Our second application is a formality theorem for the schematization\nof a complex projective manifold. Finally, we present conditions on a complex\nprojective manifold $X$ under which the image of the Hurewitz morphism of\n$\\pi_{i}(X) \\to H_{i}(X)$ is a sub-Hodge structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2001 14:25:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2002 02:53:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2002 21:19:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2005 13:32:43 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2005 07:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-14"}

(B) If so, what are\nthe general properties of such a global distribution?\n  These questions are addressed within the context of an extremely simple model\nuniverse consisting of particles possessing only the property of enumerability\nexisting in a formless continuum. Since there are no pre-specified ideas of\nclocks and rods in this model universe, we are forced into fundamental\nconsiderations about the nature of spatial and temporal measurement.\n  In answer to the original two questions, the analysis tells us that a\nglobally inertial space & time can be associated with a non-trivial global\nmatter distribution, and that this distribution is necessarily fractal with\nD=2.\n  This latter result is compared with the results of modern surveys of galaxy\ndistributions (typically, Joyce, Montuori, Labini astro-ph/9901290, ApJ Lett\n1999 and other references in this paper), which find that such distributions\nare quasi-fractal with D approx = 2 on the small-to-medium scales, with the\nsituation on the medium-to-large scales being a topic of considerable debate.\nAccordingly, and bearing in mind the extreme simplicity of the model\nconsidered, the observational evidence is consistent with the interpretation\nthat the analysed point-of-view captures the cosmic reality to a good\nfirst-order approximation.
