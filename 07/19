This produces a bilateral or barrel-type morphology in synchrotron\nemission for certain viewing angles. We then consider a case with a turbulent\nexternal medium as in Balsara & Pouquet, characterized by $v_{A}(rms)/c_{s}=2$.\nSeveral important changes are found.

We argue\nthat, instead, recent observations imply that the long-duration GRBs and their\nafterglows are produced by highly relativistic jets of cannonballs (CBs)\nemitted in supernova explosions. The CBs are heated by their collision with the\nsupernova shell. The GRB is the boosted surface radiation the CBs emit as they\nreach the transparent outskirts of the shell. The exiting CBs further\ndecelerate by sweeping up interstellar matter (ISM). The early X-ray afterglow\nis dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung from the cooling CBs, the optical\nafterglow by synchrotron radiation from the ISM electrons swept up by the CBs.\nWe show that this model fits simply and remarkably well all the measured\noptical afterglows of the 15 GRBs with known redshift, including that of GRB\n990123, for which unusually prompt data are available. We demonstrate that GRB\n980425 was a normal GRB produced by SN1998bw, with standard X-ray and optical\nafterglows. We find that the very peculiar afterglow of GRB 970508 can be\nexplained if its CBs encountered a significant jump in density as they moved\nthrough the ISM. The afterglows of the nearest 8 of the known-redshift GRBs\nshow various degrees of evidence for an association with a supernova akin to\nSN1998bw. In all other cases such an association, even if present, would have\nbeen undetectable with the best current photometric sensitivities. This gives\nstrong support to the proposition that most, maybe all, of the long-duration\nGRBs are associated with supernovae.

Most previous studies of the r-process have\nconcentrated on the reaction flow of heavy unstable nuclei. Although the\nnuclear reaction network includes a few thousand heavy nuclei, only limited\nreaction flow through light-mass nuclei near the stability line has been used\nin those studies. However, in a viable scenario of the r-process in\nneutrino-driven winds, the initial condition is a high-entropy hot plasma\nconsisting of neutrons, protons, and electron-positron pairs experiencing an\nintense flux of neutrinos. In such environments light-mass nuclei as well as\nheavy nuclei are expected to play important roles in the production of seed\nnuclei and r-process elements. Thus, we have extended our fully implicit\nnuclear reaction network so that it includes all nuclei up to the neutron drip\nline for Z $ \\leq 10$, in addition to a larger network for Z $ \\geq 10$. In the\npresent nucleosynthesis study, we utilize a wind model of massive SNeII\nexplosions to study the effects of this extended network.

We find that the compression and shocking of the core gas\nduring a merger can lead to large increases in bolometric X-ray luminosities\nand emission-weighted temperatures of clusters. Cooling flows are completely\ndisrupted during equal-mass mergers, with the mass deposition rate dropping to\nzero as the cores of the clusters collide. The large increase in the cooling\ntime of the core gas strongly suggests that cooling flows will not recover from\nsuch a merger within a Hubble time. Mergers with subclumps having 1/8th of the\nmass of the main cluster are also found to disrupt a cooling flow if the merger\nis head-on. However, in this case the entropy injected into the core gas is\nrapidly radiated away and the cooling flow restarts within a few Gyr of the\nmerger. Mergers in which the subcluster has an impact parameter of 500kpc do\nnot disrupt the cooling flow, although the mass deposition rate is reduced by\n\\~30%. Finally, we find that equal mass, off-centre mergers can effectively mix\ngas in the cores of clusters, while head on mergers lead to very little mixing.\nGas stripped from the outer layers of subclumps results in parts of the outer\nlayers of the main cluster being well mixed, although they have little effect\non the gas in the core of the cluster. None of the mergers examined here\nresulted in the ICM being well mixed globally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2001 12:16:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2001 16:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Here we describe\nthe operation of several quantum logic operations of an elementary nature,\nincluding a quantum parity check and a quantum encoder, and we show how they\ncan be combined to implement a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. All of these gates\ncan be constructed using polarizing beam splitters that completely transmit one\nstate of polarization and totally reflect the orthogonal state of polarization,\nwhich allows a simple explanation of each operation. We also describe a\npolarizing beam splitter implementation of a CNOT gate that is closely\nanalogous to the quantum teleportation technique previously suggested by\nGottesman and Chuang [Nature 402, p.390 (1999)]. Finally, our approach has the\ninteresting feature that it makes practical use of a quantum-eraser technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2001 19:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2001 16:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The effect is described in the approximation\nof the single line without the conventional line mixing.

This function enlarges the absorption of a single line approximately\nin two times in the resonance region at high pressures and decreases the one\napproximately in 20 times in far wings in comparison with the Lorentzian,\nindependently of the type of molecule and pressures.
