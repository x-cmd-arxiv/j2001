To\nreconcile quantum mechanics with relativity, these theories suggest spacetime\nis emergent. Although a consensus is growing that space is emergent from\nquantum entanglement, there is less consensus regarding emergent time. Space\nbeing emergent from quantum entanglement answers why the mathematics of quantum\nentanglement is not constrained by the geometry of space but does not account\nfor the mathematics of spacetime, which is inconsistent with quantum\nexperiments. This article reveals a solution by mathematically combining\nexisting ideas of quantum mechanics. The model resulting from this combination\nnot only predicts that space and time emerge simultaneously from quantum\nentanglement but that the mathematics of spacetime is influenced by factors\nthat differ between the quantum and cosmic scales. Specifically, two such\nfactors are identified. This new model suggests that quantum physicists have\nnot just found a way to model the world, they are reverse engineering the\nbase-code of the universe.
