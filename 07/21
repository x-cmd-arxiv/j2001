By\nincluding an extremely low external plasma pressure at large distances, we\nobtain a sequence of axisymmetric magnetostatic equilibria and show that there\nis a fundamental difference between field lines that are affected by the plasma\npressure and those are not (i.e., force-free). Force-free fields, while being\ntwisted by the differential rotation of the disk, expand outward at an angle of\n$\\sim 60^\\circ$ away from the rotation axis, consistent with the previous\nstudies. These force-free field lines, however, are enclosed by the outer field\nlines which originate from small disk radii and come back to the disk at large\nradii. These outer fields experience most of the twist, and they are also\naffected most by the external plasma pressure. At large cylindrical radial\ndistances, magnetic pressure and plasma pressure are comparable so that any\nfurther radial expansion of magnetic fields is prevented or slowed down greatly\nby this pressure. This hindrance to cylindrical radial expansion causes most of\nthe added twist to be distributed on the ascending portion of the field lines,\nclose to the rotation axis. Since these field lines are twisted most, the\nincreasing ratio of the toroidal $B_{\\phi}$ component to the poloidal component\n$B_{R,z}$ eventually results in the collimation of magnetic energy and flux\naround the rotation axis. We discuss the difficulty with adding a large number\nof twists within the limitations of the magnetostatic approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2001 18:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
