STACEE uses an array of large\nheliostat mirrors at the National Solar Thermal Test Facility in Albuquerque,\nNew Mexico, USA. The heliostats are used to collect Cherenkov light produced in\ngamma-ray air showers. The light is concentrated onto an array of\nphotomultiplier tubes located near the top of a tower. The construction of\nSTACEE started in 1997 and has been completed in 2001. During the 1998-99\nobserving season, we used a portion of the experiment, STACEE-32, to detect\ngamma-rays from the Crab Nebula. The completed version of STACEE uses 64\nheliostat mirrors, having a total collection area of 2300 m^2. During the last\nyear, we have also installed custom electronics for pulse delay and triggering,\nand 1 GHz Flash ADCs to read out the photomultiplier tubes. The commissioning\nof the full STACEE instrument is underway. Preliminary observations and\nsimulation work indicate that STACEE will have an energy threshold below 70 GeV\nand a reach for extragalactic gamma-ray sources out to redshift of ~1.0. In\nthis paper we describe the design and performance of STACEE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2001 20:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
