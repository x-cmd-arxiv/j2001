We first characterize\nthe geometric space of shears and ellipticity, then use this geometric\ninterpretation to analyse images.

These\nmethods minimize the ellipticity measurement noise, provide calculable shear\nuncertainty estimates, and allow removal of systematic contamination by PSF\neffects to arbitrary precision. Galaxy images and PSFs are decomposed into a\nfamily of orthogonal 2d Gaussian-based functions, making the PSF correction and\nshape measurement relatively straightforward and computationally efficient.

A simple model of halo growth is provided by\nPress-Schechter (PS) theory, where the initial field of density fluctuations is\nsmoothed using spherically symmetric filters centred on a given position to\nobtain information about the likelihood of later collapse on varying scales. In\nthis paper the predicted halo mass growth is compared for three filter shapes:\nGaussian, top-hat and sharp k-space. Preliminary work is also presented\nanalysing the build-up of halos within numerical simulations using a\nfriends-of-friends group finder. The best-fit to the simulation mass function\nwas obtained using PS theory with a top-hat filter. By comparing both the\nbackwards conditional mass function, which gives the distribution of halo\nprogenitors, and the distribution of halo mergers in time, the build-up of\nhalos in the simulations is shown to be better fitted by PS theory with a sharp\nk-space filter. This strengthens previous work, which also found the build-up\nof halos in simulations to be well matched to PS theory with a sharp k-space\nfilter by providing a direct comparison of different filters and by extending\nthe statistical tools used to analyse halo mass growth. The usefulness of this\nwork is illustrated by showing that the cosmological evolution in the\nproportion of halos that have undergone recent merger is predicted to be\nindependent of mass and power spectrum and to only depend upon cosmology.\nRecent results from observations of field galaxies are shown to match the\nevolution expected, but are not sufficiently accurate to usefully distinguish\nbetween cosmological parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2001 14:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Superwinds\nare complex multiphase outflows of cool, warm, and hot gas, dust, and\nmagnetized relativistic plasma. The observational manifestations of superwinds\nresult from the hydrodynamical interaction between the primary energy-carrying\nwind fluid and the ambient interstellar medium. Superwinds are ubiquitous in\ngalaxies in which the global star-formation rate per unit area exceeds roughly\n10$^{-1}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. This criterion is met by local\nstarbursts and the high-z Lyman Break galaxies. Several independent datasets\nand techniques imply that the total mass and energy outflow rates in a\nsuperwind are comparable to the starburst's star-formation-rate and mechanical\nenergy injection rate, respectively.

And how could we\ndefine conserved quantum numbers like B and L, when these are carried by\nfundamental (Dirac) fermions only, not by bosons?\n  An early attempt to relate the photon with a ``neutrino'' led us to\nR-invariance and to a new R quantum number carried by the supersymmetry\ngenerator, but this ``neutrino'' had to be reinterpreted as a new particle, the\nphotino. We also had to introduce bosons carrying ``fermion numbers'' B and L,\nwhich became the squarks and sleptons. This led to the Supersymmetric Standard\nModel, involving SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) gauge superfields interacting with chiral\nquark and lepton superfields, and two doublet Higgs superfields responsible for\nquark and lepton masses. R-parity, deeply related with B and L conservation\nlaws, appeared as a remnant of the original R-invariance, reduced to a discrete\nsymmetry so that the gravitino and gluinos can acquire masses. We also comment\nabout supersymmetry breaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2001 18:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We define a category PO of\nPoisson manifolds, whose objects are integrable Poisson manifolds and whose\narrows are isomorphism classes of regular Weinstein dual pairs; it follows that\nidentity arrows are symplectic groupoids, and that two objects are isomorphic\nin PO iff they are Morita equivalent in the sense of P. Xu. It has a\nsubcategory LPO that has duals of integrable Lie algebroids as objects and\ncotangent bundles as arrows. We argue that naive C*-algebraic quantization\nshould be functorial from LPO to the well-known category KK, whose objects are\nseparable C*-algebras and whose arrows are Kasparov's KK-groups. This limited\nfunctoriality of quantization would already imply the Atiyah-Singer index\ntheorem, as well as its far-reaching generalizations developed by Connes and\nothers. In the category KK, isomorphism of objects implies isomorphism of\nK-theory groups, so that the functoriality of quantization on all of PO would\nimply that Morita equivalent Poisson algebras are quantized by C*-algebras with\nisomorphic K-theories. Finally, we argue that the correct codomain for the\npossible functoriality of quantization is the category RKK(I), which takes the\ndeformation aspect of quantization into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2001 10:33:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2002 17:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
