We discuss the connection between departure types and the physical\nmechanisms that may cause them, mainly due to the influence by a stellar binary\ncompanion. We find that about 50 percents of all PNe possess large-scale\ndeparture from axisymmetry. This number is larger than that expected from the\ninfluence of binary companions, namely 25-30 percents. We argue that this\ndiscrepancy comes from many PNe whose departure from axisymmetry, mainly\nunequal size, shape, or intensity, results from the presence of long-lived and\nlarge, hot or cool, spots on the surface of their AGB progenitors. Such spots\nlocally enhance mass loss rate, leading to a deparure from axisymmetry, mainly\nnear the equator, in the descendant PN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2001 16:40:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

For binaries where the\nprimary evolves to fill its Roche lobe, mass transfer from the primary leads to\nthe onset of a common envelope phase during which the secondary and the core of\nthe primary spiral together as the envelope is ejected. Such binaries are the\nprogenitors of X-ray binaries if they are not broken up when the primary\nexplodes.
