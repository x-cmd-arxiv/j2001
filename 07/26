The inferred disk or ring distributions of the molecular gas is\nconsistent with the observed presence of dust disks or rings detected optically\nin the cores of the galaxies. We reason that if their gas originates from the\nmergers of two gas-rich disk galaxies, as has been invoked to explain the\nmolecular gas in other radio galaxies, then these galaxies must have merged a\nlong time ago (few Gyr or more) but their remnant elliptical galaxies only\nrecently (last 10$^7$ years or less) become active radio galaxies. Instead, we\nargue the the cannibalism of gas-rich galaxies provide a simpler explanation\nfor the origin of molecular gas in the elliptical hosts of radio galaxies (Lim\net al. 2000). Given the transient nature of their observed disturbances, these\ngalaxies probably become active in radio soon after the accretion event when\nsufficient molecular gas agglomerates in their nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2001 09:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

We use a Hubbard-Kondo model\nto clarify the role of the Fe(3+) magnetic ions in these phase transitions. In\nthe high-field regime, the magnetic field acting on the electron spins is\ncompensated by the exchange field He due to the magnetic ions. This suggests\nthat the field-induced superconducting state is the same as the zero-field\nsuperconducting state which occurs under pressure or when the Fe(3+) ions are\nreplaced by non-magnetic Ga(3+) ions. We show how He can be extracted from the\nobserved splitting of the Shubnikov-de Haas frequencies. Furthermore, we use\nthis method of extracting He to predict the field range for field-induced\nsuperconductivity in other materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2001 00:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\nwork shows that this principle is applicable in several important situations\nand suggests that the underlying principle can, in fact, be used universally.\nStarting with special relativity it is shown that there is perfect mapping\nbetween the geodesics on Minkowski space-time and on this alternative space.\nThe discussion than follows through light propagation in a refractive medium,\nand some cases of gravitation, including Schwartzschild's outer metric. The\nlast part of the presentation is dedicated to electromagnetic interaction and\nMaxwell's equations, showing that there is a particular solution where one of\nthe space dimensions is eliminated and the geodesics become equivalent to light\nrays in geometrical optics. A very brief discussion is made of the implications\nfor wave-particle duality and quantization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2001 21:10:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2001 15:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
