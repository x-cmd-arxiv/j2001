We model the properties of AGN\nlight curves at radio wavelengths using a simulated shot noise process in which\nthe occurrence of major flaring events in a relativistic jet is governed by\nPoisson statistics. We show that flaring sources whose radiation is highly\nbeamed toward us are able to reach very high flux levels, but will in fact\nspend most of their time in relatively low flaring states due to relativistic\ncontraction of flare time scales in the observer frame. The fact that highly\nbeamed AGNs do not return to a steady-state quiescent level between flares\nimplies that their weakly beamed counterparts should have highly stable flux\ndensities that result from a superposition of many long-term, low-amplitude\nflares. The ``apparent'' quiescent flux levels of these weakly beamed AGNs\n(identified in many unified models as radio galaxies) will be significantly\nhigher than their ''true'' quiescent (i.e., non-flaring) levels. We use Monte\nCarlo simulations to investigate flux variability bias in the selection\nstatistics of flat-spectrum AGN samples. In the case of the Caltech-Jodrell\nFlat-spectrum survey, the predicted orientation bias towards jets seen end-on\nis weakened if the parent population is variable, since the highly beamed\nsources have a stronger tendency to be found in low flaring states. This effect\nis small, however, since highly beamed sources are relatively rare, and their\nfluxes tend to be boosted sufficiently above the survey limit such that they\nare selected regardless of their flaring level.

Fluid Mech","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cond-mat.soft","license":null,"abstract":"  A rigid-plastic Cosserat model for slow frictional flow of granular\nmaterials, proposed by us in an earlier paper, has been used to analyze plane\nand cylindrical Couette flow. In this model, the hydrodynamic fields of a\nclassical continuum are supplemented by the couple stress and the intrinsic\nangular velocity fields. The balance of angular momentum, which is satisfied\nimplicitly in a classical continuum, must be enforced in a Cosserat continuum.\nAs a result, the stress tensor could be asymmetric, and the angular velocity of\na material point may differ from half the local vorticity. An important\nconsequence of treating the granular medium as a Cosserat continuum is that it\nincorporates a material length scale in the model, which is absent in\nfrictional models based on a classical continuum. Further, the Cosserat model\nallows determination of the velocity fields uniquely in viscometric flows, in\ncontrast to classical frictional models. Experiments on viscometric flows of\ndense, slowly deforming granular materials indicate that shear is confined to a\nnarrow region, usually a few grain diameters thick, while the remaining\nmaterial is largely undeformed. This feature is captured by the present model,\nand the velocity profile predicted for cylindrical Couette flow is in good\nagreement with reported data. When the walls of the Couette cell are smoother\nthan the granular material, the model predicts that the shear layer thickness\nis independent of the Couette gap $H$ when the latter is large compared to the\ngrain diameter $d_p$. When the walls are of the same roughness as the granular\nmaterial, the model predicts that the shear layer thickness varies as\n$(H/d_p)^{1/3}$ in the limit $(H/d_p) \\gg 1$, for plane shear under gravity and\ncylindrical Couette flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2001 08:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
