First, we show that the dark bursts cannot be explained by a failure to\nimage deeply enough quickly enough: We fit a variety of brightness distribution\nmodels to the optical data, and find that approx. 57(+13,-11)% of all bursts,\nand approx. 82(+22,-17)% of dark bursts, have afterglows that are fainter than\nR = 24 mag 18 hours after the burst. Secondly, we show that dark bursts tend to\nbe X-ray and radio faint. Thirdly, we show that these correlations, and more\nspecifically the optical vs. X-ray and optical vs. radio distributions, can be\nexplained within the framework of the relativistic fireball model if the dark\nbursts are extinguished by circumburst dust, and the density of the circumburst\nmedium spans many orders of magnitude, from densities that are typical of the\nGalactic disk to densities that are typical of dense clouds. Finally, we show\nthat Galactic extinction, host galaxy extinction unrelated to the circumburst\nmedium, and the following high redshift effects - Lyman limit absorption in the\nsource frame, absorption by the Ly-alpha forest, absorption by excited\nmolecular hydrogen in the circumburst medium, and source-frame extinction by\nthe FUV component of the extinction curve - might contribute to the number of\ndark bursts, but only in small numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2001 05:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Furthermore, the sublimation\ndistance is a decreasing function of grain size, while the fragmentation\ndistance is a decreasing function of grain size for large grains and an\nincreasing function of grain size for small grains. We investigate how these\nvery different, but somewhat complementary, processes change the optical depth\nof the circumburst medium. To this end, we adopt a canonical distribution of\ngraphite and silicate grain sizes, and a simple fragmentation model, and we\ncompute the post-burst/optical flash/afterglow optical depth of a circumburst\ncloud of constant density n and size R as a function of burst and afterglow\nisotropic-equivalent X-ray energy E and spectral index alpha, and optical flash\nisotropic-equivalent peak luminosity L: This improves upon previous analyses\nthat consider circumburst dust of a uniform grain size.

Essence of quantum computing is a direct usage of the\nsuperposition and entanglement of quantum mechanical states that are pronounced\nin nanoscopic particles such as atoms and molecules6, 7. On the other hand,\nmany proposals regarding the realization of semiconductor quantum dot (QD)\nqubits8,9 and QD quantum gates10 were reported and several experimental clues\nwere successfully found11-16. While these pioneering experiments opened up the\nbasis of semiconductor QD quantum computing, direct electrical control of\nsuperposed states in time domain17 has not been realized yet. Here, we\ndemonstrate the coherent control of the superposed quantum states evolution in\nthe QD molecule. Short electrical pulses are shown to inject single electron\ninto the QD molecule and the current collected at the substrate exhibits\noscillations as a function of the pulse width. The oscillations are originated\nfrom different decay rates of the symmetric (S) and the anti-symmetric (AS)\nstate of the QD molecule and the evolution of the occupation probabilities\ncontrolled by the injection pulse width\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2001 04:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
