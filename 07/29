In the slow-roll\napproximation, explicit closed-form long-wave solutions for field and metric\nperturbations are obtained by the analysis in the Einstein frame. Since the\nevolution of fluctuations depends on specific gravity theories, we make\ndetailed investigations based on analytic and numerical approaches in four\ngeneralized Einstein theories: the Jordan-Brans-Dicke (JBD) theory, the\nEinstein gravity with a non-minimally coupled scalar field, the\nhigher-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory, and the $R+R^2$ theory with a\nnon-minimally coupled scalar field. We find that solutions obtained in the\nslow-roll approximation show good agreement with full numerical results except\naround the end of inflation. Due to the presence of isocurvature perturbations,\nthe gravitational potential $\\Phi$ and the curvature perturbations ${\\cal R}$\nand $\\zeta$ do not remain constant on super-horizon scales. In particular, we\nfind that negative non-minimal coupling can lead to strong enhancement of\n${\\cal R}$ in both the Einstein and higher derivative gravity, in which case it\nis difficult to unambiguously decompose scalar perturbations into adiabatic and\nisocurvature modes during the whole stage of inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2001 13:06:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2001 04:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
