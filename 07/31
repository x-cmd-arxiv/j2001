As a specific example we\nmodel the emission from SN1993J, which cannot be adequately fitted with the\noften-used analytic mini-shell model, and present a good fit to the radio\nevolution at a single frequency. Both free-free absorption and syncrotron self-\nabsorption are needed to fit the light curve at early times and a circumstellar\ndensity profile of rho~r^-1.7 provides the best fit to the later data. We show\nthat the interaction of density structures in the ejecta with the reverse\nsupernova shock may produce features in the radio light curves such as have\nbeen observed. We discuss the use of high-resolution radio images of supernovae\nto distinguish between different absorption mechanisms and determine the origin\nof specific light curve features. Comparisons of VLBI images of SN1993J with\nsynthetic model images suggest that internal free-free absorption completely\nobscures emission at 8.4 GHz passing through the center of the supernova for\nthe first few tens of years after explosion. We predict that at 8.4 GHz the\ninternal free-free absorption is currently declining, and that over the next 40\nyears the surface brightness of the center of the source should increase\nrelative to the bright ring of emission seen in VLBI images. Similar absorption\nin a nearby supernova would make the detection of a radio pulsar at 1 GHz\nimpossible for ~150 years after explosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2001 20:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The neuronal network is composed of many Hebbian\nautoassociators, or modules, each of which interacts with a relatively small\nnumber of the others. Every module encodes and stores a number of elementary\npercepts, or features. Memory items, or patterns, are peculiar combinations of\nfeatures sparsely distributed over the multi-modular network. Any feature\nstored in any module can be involved in several of the stored patterns;\nfeature-sharing is in fact source of local ambiguities and, consequently, a\npotential cause of erroneous memory retrieval activity spreading through the\nmodel network.\n  The memory retrieval dynamics of the large multi-modular autoassociator is\ninvestigated by means of quantitative analysis and numerical simulations. An\noscillatory retrieval process is found to be very efficient in overcoming\nfeature-sharing drawbacks; it requires a mechanism that modulates the\nrobustness of local attractors to noise, and neuronal activity sparseness such\nthat quiescent and active modules are about equally noisy. Correlated\nactivation of interconnected modules and extramodular neuronal contacts more\neffective than the intramodular ones seem to be general requirements in order\nto efficiently achieve satisfactory quality of memory retrieval. It is also\nshown that, even in ideal conditions, some spots of the network cannot be\nreached by retrieval activity spread. The locations of these activity isles\ndepend on the pattern to retrieve and on the cue, while their extension only\ndepends on architecture of the graph and statistics of the stored patterns. The\nexistence of these isles determines an upper-bound to retrieval quality that\ndoes not depend on the specific retrieval dynamics adopted, nor on whether\nfeature-sharing is permitted. The oscillatory retrieval process nearly\nsaturates this bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2001 19:49:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2004 22:04:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 22:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

A\ncrucial factor in the creation of adaptable systems dealing with changing\nrequirements is the suitability of the underlying technology in allowing the\nevolution of the system. A reflective system utilizes an open architecture\nwhere implicit system aspects are reified to become explicit first-class\n(meta-data) objects. These implicit system aspects are often fundamental\nstructures which are inaccessible and immutable, and their reification as\nmeta-data objects can serve as the basis for changes and extensions to the\nsystem, making it self- describing. To address the evolvability issue, this\npaper proposes a reflective architecture based on two orthogonal abstractions -\nmodel abstraction and information abstraction. In this architecture the\nmodeling abstractions allow for the separation of the description meta-data\nfrom the system aspects they represent so that they can be managed and\nversioned independently, asynchronously and explicitly. A practical example of\nthis philosophy, the CRISTAL project, is used to demonstrate the use of\nmeta-data objects to handle system evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2001 17:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2001 12:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
