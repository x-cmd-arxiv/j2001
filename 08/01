One advantage of this\nrelatively bright flux-density limit is that accurate astrometric positions are\npotentially achievable for every source using existing radio and/or mm-wave\ninterferometers. However, an associated advantage is that SED-based redshift\nconstraints should be more powerful than in fainter sub-mm surveys. Here we\ntherefore exploit the parallel SCUBA 450um data, in combination with existing\nradio and ISO data at longer and shorter wavelengths to set constraints on the\nredshift of each source. We also analyse new and existing optical and\nnear-infrared imaging of our SCUBA survey fields to select potential\nidentifications consistent with these constraints. Our derived SED-based\nredshift constraints, and the lack of statistically significant associations\nwith even moderately bright galaxies allow us to conclude that all 19 sources\nlie at z > 1, and at least half of them apparently lie at z > 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2001 16:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2001 09:35:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2001 18:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This surface mass density contrast as a function of\nradius is a measure of the galaxy-mass correlation function (GMCF). Because\nspectroscopic redshifts are available for all lens objects, the mass and\ndistance scales are well constrained.

The J and K band data are modelled using a\nscattering code to determine the shell parameters and dust properties. We find\nthat the observations are well described by a spherically symmetric\ndistribution of dust with an inverse square density law, indicating that when\nmass-loss was occurring, the mass-loss rate was constant.

In the unconstrained model, there are portions of the parameter\nspace yielding a large CP asymmetry at leading order (LO). In these regions, we\nfind that the CP phases satisfy certain sum rules, e.g., the sum of the phases\nof the \\mu parameter and the stop trilinear coupling centralize around \\pi with\na width determined by the experimental bounds. In addition, at large values of\ntan(beta), the sign of the CP asymmetry tracks the sign of the gluino mass, and\nthe CP asymmetry is significantly larger than the LO prediction. In the\nconstrained minimal supersymmetric standard model based on minimal\nsupergravity, we find that the decay rate is sensitive to the phase of the\nuniversal trilinear coupling.
