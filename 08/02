We identify four important factors for\nunderstanding rapid star formation and short cloud lifetimes. First, much of\nthe accumulation and dispersal of clouds near the solar circle might occur in\nthe atomic phase; only the high-density portion of a cloud's lifecycle is spent\nin the molecular phase, thus helping to limit molecular cloud ``lifetimes''.\nSecond, once a cloud achieves a high enough column density to form $\\h2$ and\nCO, gravitational forces become larger than typical interstellar pressure\nforces; thus star formation can follow rapidly upon molecular gas formation and\nturbulent dissipation in limited areas of each cloud complex. Third, typical\nmagnetic fields are not strong enough to prevent rapid cloud formation and\ngravitational collapse. Fourth, rapid dispersal of gas by newly-formed stars,\nand reduction of shielding by a small expansion of the cloud after the first\nevents of star formation, might limit the length of the star formation epoch\nand the lifetime of a cloud in its molecular state. This picture emphasizes the\nimportance of large-scale boundary conditions for understanding molecular cloud\nformation, and implies that star formation is a highly dynamic, rather than\nquasi-static, process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2001 19:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

These data were\nobtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). Although\nprevious optical CMDs of NGC 2808 show a high temperature gap within the hot HB\npopulation, no such gap is evident in our UV CMD. Instead, we find a population\nof hot subluminous HB stars, an anomaly only previously reported for the\nglobular cluster omega Cen. Our modeling indicates that the location of these\nsubluminous stars in the UV CMD, as well as the high temperature gap along the\nHB in optical CMDs, can be explained if these stars underwent a late He-core\nflash while descending the white dwarf cooling curve. We show that the\nconvection zone produced by such a late He flash will penetrate into the H\nenvelope, thereby mixing H into the hot He-burning interior, where it is\nrapidly consumed. This phenomenon is analogous to the \"born again\" scenario for\nproducing H-deficient stars following a late He-shell flash. The flash mixing\nof the envelope greatly enhances the envelope He and C abundances, and leads,\nin turn, to a discontinuous increase in the HB effective temperatures at the\ntransition between canonical and flash-mixed stars. We argue that the hot HB\ngap is associated with this theoretically predicted dichotomy in the HB\nproperties. Moreover, the changes in the emergent spectral energy distribution\ncaused by these abundance changes are primarily responsible for explaining the\nhot subluminous HB stars. Although further evidence is needed to confirm that a\nlate He-core flash can account for the subluminous HB stars and the hot HB gap,\nwe demonstrate that an understanding of these stars requires the use of\nappropriate theoretical models for their evolution, atmospheres, and spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2001 15:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is shown here that for relatively low intensity of\nthe driving field the EIT linewidth is proportional to the square root of\nintensity and is independent of the Doppler width, similar to the laser induced\nline narrowing effect by Feld and Javan. In the limit of high intensity we\nrecover the usual power broadening case where EIT linewidth is proportional to\nthe intensity and inversely proportional to the Doppler width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2001 19:39:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2001 01:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
