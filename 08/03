It is shown that the electron system in both\nsuperconducting and normal states exhibits characteristic features of a quantum\nprotectorate after the point of this fermion-condensation quantum phase\ntransition. The single-particle spectrum of a superconductor can be represented\nby two straight lines corresponding to two effective masses $M^*_{FC}$ and\n$M^*_{L}$. The $M^*_{FC}$ mass characterizes the spectrum up to the binding\nenergy $E_0$ and $M^*_L$ determines the spectrum at higher binding energies.\nBoth effective masses are retained in the normal state. These results are used\nto explain the lineshape of single-particle excitations and other properties of\nhigh-$T_c$ superconductors and are in a good agreement with recent experimental\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2001 13:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This invalidates the low energy perturbative expansion, gives rise to\nmany new unknown parameters, and makes it impossible to reliably calculate the\nrelation between the partially quenched theory and low energy QCD. We show that\nit is straightforward and natural to formulate partially quenched chiral\nperturbation theory without $\\Phi_0$, and that the resulting theory contains\nthe effective theory for QCD without the $\\eta'$.

In turn, these moments can induce electric dipole moments\n(EDMs) in atoms through the mixing of electron wavefunctions of opposite\nparity. The nuclear EDM is screened by atomic electrons. The EDM of an atom\nwith closed electron subshells is induced by the nuclear Schiff moment.\nPreviously the interaction with the Schiff moment has been defined for a\npoint-like nucleus. No problems arise with the calculation of the electron\nmatrix element of this interaction as long as the electrons are considered to\nbe non-relativistic. However, a more realistic model obviously involves a\nnucleus of finite-size and relativistic electrons. In this work we have\ncalculated the finite nuclear-size and relativistic corrections to the Schiff\nmoment. The relativistic corrections originate from the electron wavefunctions\nand are incorporated into a ``nuclear'' moment, which we term the local dipole\nmoment. For mercury these corrections amount to about 25%. We have found that\nthe natural generalization of the electrostatic potential of the Schiff moment\nfor a finite-size nucleus corresponds to an electric field distribution which,\ninside the nucleus, is well approximated as constant and directed along the\nnuclear spin, and outside the nucleus is zero.

The standard result of generalized privacy\namplification yields an upper bound only on the average value of the mutual\ninformation available to an eavesdropper. Unfortunately this result by itself\nis inadequate for cryptographic applications. A naive application of the\nstandard result leads one to incorrectly conclude that an acceptable upper\nbound on the mutual information has been achieved. It is the pointwise value of\nthe bound on the mutual information, associated with the use of some specific\nhash function, that corresponds to actual implementations. We provide a fully\nrigorous mathematical derivation that shows how to obtain a cryptographically\nacceptable upper bound on the actual, pointwise value of the mutual\ninformation. Unlike the bound on the average mutual information, the value of\nthe upper bound on the pointwise mutual information and the number of bits by\nwhich the secret key is compressed are specified by two different parameters,\nand the actual realization of the bound in the pointwise case is necessarily\nassociated with a specific failure probability. The constraints amongst these\nparameters, and the effect of their values on the system throughput, have not\nbeen previously analyzed. We show that the necessary shortening of the key\ndictated by the cryptographically correct, pointwise bound, can still produce\nviable throughput rates that will be useful in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2001 22:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
