The formation of the protogalaxies\nresponsible for reionization and metal-enrichment of the intergalactic medium,\nthen had to await the collapse of larger halos. Here we investigate the\nradiative cooling and collapse of gas in halos with virial temperatures Tvir >\n10^4K. In these halos, efficient atomic line radiation allows rapid cooling of\nthe gas to 8000 K; subsequently the gas can contract nearly isothermally at\nthis temperature. Without an additional coolant, the gas would likely settle\ninto a locally gravitationally stable disk; only disks with unusually low spin\nwould be unstable. However, we find that the initial atomic line cooling leaves\na large, out-of-equilibrium residual free electron fraction. This allows the\nmolecular fraction to build up to a universal value of about x(H2) = 10^-3,\nalmost independently of initial density and temperature. We show that this is a\nnon--equilibrium freezeout value that can be understood in terms of timescale\narguments. Furthermore, unlike in less massive halos, H2 formation is largely\nimpervious to feedback from external UV fields, due to the high initial\ndensities achieved by atomic cooling. The H2 molecules cool the gas further to\nabout 100K, and allow the gas to fragment on scales of a few 100 Msun.

We have reanalysed the proposed solution to the atmospheric\nneutrino anomaly in terms of non-standard neutrino-matter interactions (NSI) as\nwell as the standard nu_mu -> nu_tau oscillations (OSC). Our statistical\nanalysis shows that a pure NSI mechanism is now ruled out at 99%, while the\nstandard nu_mu -> nu_tau OSC mechanism provides a quite remarkably good\ndescription of the anomaly. We therefore study an extended mechanism of\nneutrino propagation which combines both oscillation and non-standard\nneutrino-matter interactions, in order to derive limits on flavour-changing\n(FC) and non-universal (NU) neutrino interactions. We obtain that the\noff-diagonal flavour-changing neutrino parameter epsilon and the diagonal\nnon-universality neutrino parameter epsilon' are confined to -0.03 < epsilon <\n0.02 and |epsilon'| < 0.05 at 99.73% CL. These limits are model independent and\nthey are obtained from pure neutrino-physics processes. The stability of the\nneutrino oscillation solution to the atmospheric neutrino anomaly against the\npresence of non-standard neutrino interactions establishes the robustness of\nthe near-maximal atmospheric mixing and massive-neutrino hypothesis. The best\nagreement with the data is obtained for Delta_m^2 = 2.3*10^{-3} eV^2,\nsin^2(2*theta) = 1, epsilon = 6.7*10^{-3} and epsilon' = 1.1*10^{-3}, although\nthe chi^2 function is quite flat in the epsilon and epsilon' directions for\nepsilon, epsilon' -> 0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2001 00:37:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2001 12:52:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2003 17:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-28"}
