Our\nanalysis takes into account the rapid rotation of the star and the lift-up of\nthe burning ocean during the burst. We find a new regime for spreading of a\nnuclear burning front, where the flame is carried along a coherent shear flow\nacross the front. If turbulent viscosity is weak, the speed of flame\npropagation is ~20 km/s, while, if turbulent viscosity is dynamically\nimportant, the flame speed increases, and reaches the maximum value, ~300 km/s,\nwhen the eddy overturn frequency is comparable to the Coriolis parameter. We\nshow that, due to rotationally reduced gravity, the thermonuclear runaway is\nlikely to begin on the equator. The equatorial belt is ignited first, and the\nflame then propagates from the equator to the poles. Inhomogeneous cooling\n(equator first, poles second) drives strong zonal currents which may be\nunstable to formation of Jupiter-type vortices; we conjecture that these\nvortices are responsible for modulation of X-ray flux in the tails of some\nbursts. We consider the effect of strong zonal currents on the frequency of\nmodulation of the X-ray flux and show that the large values of the frequency\ndrifts observed in some bursts can be accounted for within our model combined\nwith the model of homogeneous radial expansion. Also, if inhomogeneities are\ntrapped in the forward zonal flows around the propagating burning front, chirps\nwith large frequency ranges (~25-500 Hz) may be detectable during the burst\nrise. We argue that an MHD dynamo within the burning front can generate a\nsmall-scale magnetic field, which may enforce vertically rigid flow in the\nfront's wake and can explain the coherence of oscillations in the burst tail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2001 23:17:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
