The\nselected areas are two fields near the cloud center and are observed with the\nACIS-I array of a 17'x17' size and a ~100 ks exposure. Among 18 bona-fide and\ncandidate brown dwarfs listed by the infrared spectroscopy, we find X-ray\nemission from 7 sources above 99.9% confidence level. Therefore ~40% of the\ninfrared-selected brown dwarfs in this cloud emit X-rays. For the brightest 4\nsources, the X-ray spectra are made and are fitted with a thin-thermal plasma\nmodel of a temperature 1-2.5 keV. The X-rays are also time variable with rapid\nflares from 2 of the brown dwarfs. Assuming 2 keV temperature and using the\nempirical relation of Av vs. NH, we estimate the X-ray luminosity or its upper\nlimit of the other faint or non-X-ray sources. The X-ray luminosity (Lx) of the\nX-ray-detected sources is in the range of 0.3-90x10^28 ergs s^-1, while the\nluminosity ratio of X-ray to bolometric (Lx/Lbol) is 10^-3 - 10^-5, similar to\nthose of low-mass pre-main-sequence and dMe stars. All these results suggest\nthat the X-ray origin of brown dwarfs is the same as low-mass stars; strong\nmagnetic activity at the stellar surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2001 02:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

There are some low\nmass X-ray binaries (LMXB) like 4U 1820-30, 4U 1636-53, KS 1731-260 and Serpens\nX-1, known as Super Bursters (SB) which emit X-rays close to the Eddington\nluminosity limit for long periods of several hours. Recently there are reports\nof some long bursters (LB), which have bursts lasting 6-25 minutes, whereas the\n4U 1735-44 has a burst period of 86 minutes. We suggest that these bursts from\nSB and LB may be due to breaking and re-formation of diquark pairs, on the\nsurface of realistic strange quark stars. We use the beta equilibrated u, d and\ns quark model of Dey et al. (1998) and Li et al. (1999a and 1999b) and allow\nfor spin dependent hyperfine interaction between quarks. The interaction\nproduces pairing of specific colour-spin diquarks, leading to further lowering\nof energy by several MeV-s for each pair, on the average. Diquarks are expected\nto break up due to the explosion and shock of the TN process. The subsequent\nproduction of copious diquark pairing may produce sufficient energy to produce\nthe very long bursts seen in SB or LB. The estimated total energy liberated,\n10^{42} ergs, can be explained in our model with the calculated pair density ~\n0.275/fm^3 and a surface thickness of only half a micron, if the entire surface\nis involved. The depth of the surface involved in the process may be only few\nmicrons if the process is restricted to small part of the surface near the\nequator as suggested by Bildsten.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2001 09:42:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2002 17:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

The focus is primarily on the relationship\nbetween the quasiparticle energy eigenvalue spectrum and the geometrical shape\nof the normal-state region, i.e., the question of spectral geometry in the\nnovel setting of excitations confined by a superconducting pair-potential.\nAmong the central results of this investigation are two semiclassical trace\nformulas for the density of states. The first, a lower-resolution formula,\ncorresponds to the well-known quasiclassical approximation, conventionally\ninvoked in settings involving superconductivity.

This\nlevel density depends on the billiard shape only through the set of\nstationary-length chords of the billiard and the curvature of the boundary at\nthe endpoints of these chords; and (ii) Higher-resolution corrections to the\nlevel density, expressed as a sum over periodic orbits that creep around the\nbilliard boundary.

These models originate from the representability\ntheory and their practical implementation may lead to essential reduction of\ndimensions of intermediate Configuration Interaction spaces. A certain\nzero-order theory that gives wave functions approximately equivalent to ones\nobtained by accounting all excitations from the Hartree-Fock reference state up\nto the q-th order is proposed. Simple numerical examples are given to\nillustrate the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2001 09:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
