We suggest that the outflowing gas (a wind) causes UV\nemission seen in mid-eclipse, narrow UV absorption lines, and broad UV P Cygni\nlines. Observations with the FOS and STIS spectrographs on the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) show UV emission lines in the middle of X-ray eclipse, when the\nX-ray heated atmosphere of the normal star and accretion disk should be\nentirely hidden from view. Narrow absorption lines (FWHM~50 km/s) blueshifted\nby 500 km/s during observations in 1998 and by 400 km/s during observations in\n1999 were seen from phi=0.0-0.3. The line velocity was constant to within 20\nkm/s. The P Cygni profiles from Hercules~X-1 have optical depths tau<1 with a\nmaximum expansion velocity of 600 km/s, and are seen in the resonance lines N V\n1238.8,1242.8, Si IV 1393.7,1402.8, and C IV 1548.2, 1550.8.
