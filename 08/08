This model predicts that sub-mm luminosity peaks\nafter only ~ 0.2 Gyr. However, without a very massive seed black hole,\nEddington-limited growth means that a black hole mass of 10^9 solar masses, and\nhence very luminous AGN activity, cannot be produced until > 0.5 Gyr after the\nformation of the first massive stars in the halo. The model thus predicts a\ntime-lag between the peak of sub-mm luminosity and AGN luminosity in a massive\nproto-elliptical of a few times 10^8 years. For a formation redshift z = 5,\nthis means that powerful AGN activity is delayed until z = 3.5, by which time\nstar formation in the host is 90% complete, and sub-mm luminosity has declined\nto ~ 25% of its peak value. This provides a natural explanation for why\nsuccessful sub-mm detections of luminous radio galaxies are largely confined to\nz > 2.5. Conversely the model also predicts that while all high-redshift\nluminous sub-mm-selected sources should contain an active (and growing) black\nhole, the typical luminosity of the AGN in such objects is ~1000 times smaller\nthan that of the most powerful AGN. This is consistent with the almost complete\nfailure to detect sub-mm selected galaxies with existing X-ray surveys. Finally\nthe model yields a black-hole:spheroid mass ratio which evolves rapidly in the\nfirst Gyr, but asymptotes to ~ 0.001-0.003 in agreement with results at low\nredshift.

Spiral structure is\nformed within Roche limit by self-gravity and energy dissipation of inelastic\ncollisions, and angular momentum is effectively transfered outward. Angular\nmomentum transfer is dominated by both gravitational torque due to the spiral\nstructure and particles' collective motion associated with the structure.

A\ncanonical history action is posited on $\\cal G$ such that its restriction to\nthe configuration history space yields the familiar Polyakov action. The\nstandard Dirac-ADM action is shown to be identical with the canonical history\naction, the only difference being that the underlying action is expressed in\ntwo different coordinate charts on $\\cal G$. The canonical history action\nencompasses all individual Dirac-ADM actions corresponding to different choices\n$\\sf T$ of foliating $\\cal Y$. The history Poisson brackets of spacetime fields\non $\\cal G$ induce the ordinary Poisson brackets of spatial fields in the\ninstantaneous phase space ${\\cal G}_{0}$ of the Dirac-ADM formalism. The\ncanonical history action is manifestly invariant both under spacetime\ndiffeomorphisms Diff$\\cal Y$ and temporal diffeomorphisms Diff$\\cal T$. Both of\nthese diffeomorphisms are explicitly represented by symplectomorphisms on the\nhistory phase space $\\cal G$. The resulting classical history phase space\nformalism is offered as a starting point for projection operator quantization\nand consistent histories interpretation of the bosonic string model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2001 10:15:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2001 09:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We find such waves for equations in two\nspace dimensions with focusing-defocusing nonlinearities, such as\ncubic-quintic. Spectrally stable waves resemble a vortex (non-localized\nsolution with asymptotically constant amplitude) cut off at large radius by a\nkink layer that exponentially localizes the solution.\n  For the evolution equations linearized about a localized spinning wave, we\nprove that unstable eigenvalues are zeros of Evans functions for a finite set\nof ordinary differential equations. Numerical computations indicate that there\nexist spectrally stable standing waves having central vortex of any degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2001 16:31:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2002 00:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The relativistic measurement of position is placed in the\ncontext of an information theoretic interpretation of quantum mechanics as a\ntheory of measurement results. The law of geodesic motion is seen as consequent\non the refraction of the wave function due curvature, as in geometric optics.\nThe k-calculus is extended to include gravitational red shift and to account\nfor gravity by observing that, after allowing a small inherent delay in the\nreflection of a photon, the metric defined by the radar method obeys Einstein's\nfield equation.
