The two probes of the mass function, lens\nseparations and the local velocity function, are mutually consistent.

We focus on the so called low-energy option\nand discuss principles for optimizing experimental parameters to measure these\ntwo quantities simultaneously. Toward the goal, we first formulate a method for\nobtaining a bird-eye view of the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation by\nintroducing a new powerful tool called the ``CP trajectory diagram in\nbi-probability space''. It allows us to represent pictorially the three effects\nseparately in a single diagram; effect from genuine CP violation due to the sin\ndelta term, effect from the CP conserving cos delta term, and the fake CP\nviolating effect due to earth matter. By using the CP trajectory diagram we\nobserve that there is a two-fold ambiguity in the determination of delta which\nis related with the sign of Delta m^2_{13}. We then address the question of\nwhat are the promising options for conceptual design of experiments at low\nenergies which looks for CP violation and at the same time would resolve the\ntwo-fold ambiguity. We point out that a version with distance of about 700 km,\nwith a megaton class water Cherenkov detector gives an optimal design which\nallows simultaneous determination of delta and the sign of Delta m^2_{13} {\\it\nin situ}.
