For each halo at\nz=0, we identify its merger-history tree, and determine concentration\nparameters c_vir for all progenitors, thus providing a structural merger tree\nfor each halo. We fit the mass accretion histories by a universal function with\none parameter, the formation epoch a_c, defined when the log mass accretion\nrate dlogM/dloga falls below a critical value S. We find that late forming\ngalaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that c_vir ``observed'' at any\nepoch a_o is strongly correlated with a_c via c_vir=c_1*a_o/a_c. Scatter about\nthis relation is mostly due to measurement errors in c_v and a_c, implying that\nthe actual spread in c_vir for halos of a given mass can be mostly attributed\nto scatter in a_c. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to\npredict the mass and redshift dependence of c_v, and the scatter about the\nmedian c_vir(M,z), using accretion histories derived from the Extended\nPress-Schechter (EPS) formalism, after adjusting for a constant offset between\nthe formation times as predicted by EPS and as measured in the simulations;this\nnew ingredient can thus be easily incorporated into semi-analytic models of\ngalaxy formation. The correlation found between halo concentration and mass\naccretion rate suggests a physical interpretation: for high mass infall rates\nthe central density is related to the background density; when the mass infall\nrate slows, the central density stays approximately constant and the halo\nconcentration just grows as R_vir. The tight correlation demonstrated here\nprovides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2001 21:27:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2001 00:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We compare\nN(z) of different spectral types with models, showing that the observations are\ninconsistent with simple PLE models while the SAM provides a reasonable fit to\nthe total N(z) but underestimates the number of z ~ 1 red spectral types. We\nalso present N(z) for samples of red objects (EROs). We find that EROs with R -\nH > 4 and H < 20.5 have z_m ~ 1; redder EROs have higher z_m. For 19 < H < 20,\nEROs with R - H > 4 comprise ~18% of the observed galaxy population while in\nthe SAM they contribute only ~4%. We also determine the angular correlation\nfunction w(theta) for magnitude, colour, spectral type and photo-z selected\nsamples and use the estimated N(z) to derive the spatial clustering xi(r).\nParametrizing xi(r) by xi(r_c,z)=(r_c/r_*(z))^(-1.8) (r_c comoving), we find\nthat r_*(z) increases by ~1.5-2 times from z = 0 to z ~ 1.2. We interpret this\nas a selection effect - the galaxies selected at z ~ 1.2 are intrinsically very\nluminous. When galaxies are selected by absolute magnitude we find no evidence\nfor evolution in r_* over this z range. Extrapolated to z = 0, we find r_*(0) ~\n6.5 h^-1Mpc for red galaxies and r_*(0) ~ 2-4 h^-1Mpc for blue galaxies. We\nalso find that while the angular clustering amplitude of EROs with R - H > 4 or\nI - H > 3 is up to four times that of the whole galaxy population, the spatial\nclustering length r_*(z=1) is ~7.5-10.5 h^-1Mpc which is only a factor of ~1.7\ntimes r_* for non-EROs lying in a similar z and luminosity range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2001 13:31:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2002 14:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

As experienced in a Rindler\nconstant acceleration frame the electromagnetic quantum vacuum mainfests an\nenergy-momentum flux which we call the Rindler flux (RF). The RF, and its\nrelative, Unruh-Davies radiation, both stem from event-horizon effects in\naccelerating reference frames. The force of radiation pressure produced by the\nRF proves to be proportional to the acceleration of the reference frame, which\nleads to the hypothesis that at least part of the inertia of an object should\nbe due to the interaction of its quarks and electrons with the RF. We\ndemonstrate that this quantum vacuum inertia hypothesis is consistent with\ngeneral relativity (GR) and that it answers a fundamental question left open\nwithin GR, viz. is there a physical mechanism that generates the reaction force\nknown as weight when a specific non-geodesic motion is imposed on an object?\nThe quantum vacuum inertia hypothesis provides such a mechanism, since by\nassuming the Einstein principle of local Lorentz-invariance (LLI), we can\nimmediately show that the same RF arises due to curved spacetime geometry as\nfor acceleration in flat spactime.
