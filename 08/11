We argue that tachyon condensation\ndrives these orbifolds to flat space or supersymmetric ALE spaces. The decay\nproceeds via an expanding shell of dilaton gradients and curvature which\ninterpolates between two regions of distinct angular geometry. The string\ncoupling remains weak throughout. For small tachyon VEVs, evidence comes from\nquiver theories on D-branes probes, in which deformations by twisted couplings\nsmoothly connect non-supersymmetric orbifolds to supersymmetric orbifolds of\nreduced order. For large tachyon VEVs, evidence comes from worldsheet RG flow\nand spacetime gravity. For $\\IC^2/\\IZ_n$, we exhibit infinite sequences of\ntransitions producing SUSY ALE spaces via twisted closed string condensation\nfrom non-supersymmetric ALE spaces. In a $T$-dual description this provides a\nmechanism for creating NS5-branes via {\\it closed} string tachyon condensation\nsimilar to the creation of D-branes via {\\it open} string tachyon condensation.\nWe also apply our results to recent duality conjectures involving fluxbranes\nand the type 0 string.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2001 22:12:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2001 19:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2001 17:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
