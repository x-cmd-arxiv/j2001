In particular, we find that the evolution of the average luminosity\ncan be parameterized as L ~ (1+z)^(1.4 +- 0.5), where z is the burst redshift.\nWe discuss the possible reasons behind this evolution and compare it to other\nknown sources that exhibit similar behavior. In addition, we use non-parametric\nstatistical techniques to independently estimate the distributions of the\nluminosity and redshift of bursts, accounting for the evolution (in contrast to\nprevious studies which have assumed that the luminosity function is independent\nof redshift). We present these distributions and discuss their implications.\nMost significantly, we find a co-moving rate density of GRBs that continues to\nincrease to (1+z) ~ 10. From this estimate of the GRB rate density, we then use\nthe population synthesis codes of Fryer et al. (1999) to estimate the star\nformation rate at high redshifts, based on different progenitor models of GRBs.\nWe find that no matter what the progenitor or population synthesis model, the\nstar formation rate increases or remains constant to very high redshifts (z ~\n10).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2001 17:24:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2002 20:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Accretion of SIDM onto seed black holes can produce supermassive\nblack holes that are too large for certain combinations of parameters,which is\nused to obtain a new constraint on the dark matter interaction. Constraints due\nto other considerations are presented and previous ones are generalized. The\nblack hole constraint is extremely sensitive to the slope \\alpha, of the inner\ndensity profile of dark halos. For the most probable value of \\alpha=1.3, there\nexists a narrow range in parameter space, such that all constraints are\nsatisfied. However, the adiabatic compression of the dark halo by baryons as\nthey cool and contract in normal galaxies yields a steeper cusp, \\alpha=1.7.\nThis gives a tighter constraint, which would exclude SIDM as a possible\nsolution to the purported problems with CDM in the absence of other dynamical\nprocesses. Nevertheless, SIDM with parameters consistent with this stronger\nconstraint, can explain the ubiquity of supermassive black holes in the centers\nof galaxies. A ``best fit'' model is presented which reproduces the\nsupermassive black hole masses and their observed correlations with the\nvelocity dispersion of the host bulges. Specifically, the fourth power\ndependence of black hole mass on velocity dispersion is a direct consequence of\nthe power spectrum having an index of n=-2. Although the dark matter collision\nrates for this model are too small to directly remedy problems with CDM,\nmergers between dark halos harboring supermassive black holes at high redshift\ncould ameliorate the cuspy halo problem. This scenario also explains the lack\nof comparable supermassive black holes in bulgeless galaxies like M33.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Aug 2001 11:02:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2001 02:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
