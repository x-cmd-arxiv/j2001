The hole concentration, p, as a\nfunction of the fraction of Mn sites, x, is parametrized in terms of the\nproduct m*J_{pd}^2 (where m* is the hole effective mass and J_{pd} is the\nKondo-like hole/local-moment coupling), and the critical temperature Tc. By\nusing experimental data for these quantities, we have established the\ndependence of the hole concentration with x, which can be associated with the\noccurrence of a reentrant metal-insulator transition taking place in the hole\ngas. We also calculate the dependence of the Mn magnetization with x, for\ndifferent temperatures (T), and found that as T increases, the width of the\ncomposition-dependent magnetization decreases drammatically, and that the\nmagnetization maxima also decreases, indicating the need for quality-control of\nMn-doping composition in diluted magnetic semiconductor devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2001 12:14:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2002 20:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This\nsolution was found in hep-th/0007191, and its asymptotic form describing\nlogarithmic RG flow was constructed in hep-th/0002159. The leading tree-level\nstring correction to the type IIB string effective action is represented by the\ninvariant of the form $\\a'{}^3 (R^4 + ...)$. Since the background contains\n3-form field strengths, we need to know parts of this invariant that depend on\nthem. By analyzing the 5-point superstring scattering amplitudes we show that\nonly a few specific $R^3 (H_3)^2$ and $R^3 (F_3)^2$ terms are present in the\neffective action.\n  Their contribution to the holographic RG flow turns out to be of the same\norder as of the $R^4$ terms. Using this fact we show that it is possible to\nhave agreement between the $\\alpha'$-corrected radial dependence of the\nsupergravity fields and the RG flow dictated by the NSVZ beta functions in\nfield theory. The agreement with field theory requires that the anomalous\ndimension of the operators $\\Tr (A_i B_j)$ is corrected by a term of order\n$(M/N)^4 \\lambda^{-1/2}$ from its value $-{1 \\over 2} $ found for M=0\n($\\lambda$ is the appropriate 't Hooft coupling which is assumed to be strong).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2001 18:01:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2001 16:25:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2001 16:02:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2001 21:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}
