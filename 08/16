In addition, the data have been validated by\nanalytical computations for an identical cosmology, with density parameter\n$\\Omega_m = 0.3$ and vacuum energy density parameter $\\lambda_0 = 0.7$. This\npaper reports on the scale and redshift dependence of the shear variance,\n$<\\gamma^2>$, which may be described by a simple formula of the form\n$<\\gamma^2>(\\theta,z_s) = a(\\theta)z_s^{b(\\theta)}$. The redshift dependence\nfor source redshifts up to 1.6, is found to be close to $z_s^2$, which is a\nstronger dependence than earlier analytical predictions ($<\\gamma^2 > \\propto\nz_s^{1.52}$), although, at higher redshifts, the $z_s$ dependence of the shear\nvariance is clearly less steep. The strong redshift dependence further\nemphasises the need to know the precise redshift distribution for the galaxy\nsources in any given survey, so that they can be allocated to redshift bins\naccordingly, and the cosmic shear signal correctly interpreted.

We define the `bias' parameter b_QG as the ratio of the\ncross-correlation function xi_QG to the galaxy auto-correlation function xi_GG.\nOn scales larger than 1 h^{-1} Mpc, the values of b_QG predicted by our models\nat low redshift depend very little on galaxy selection.

In current redshift surveys, such\nmeasurements will constrain the lifetimes of low z quasars more accurately than\nmeasurements of the quasar auto-correlation function, because galaxies have\nmuch higher space densities than quasars. On scales smaller than 1 h^{-1} Mpc,\nthe main contribution to xi_QG comes from quasar/galaxy pairs in the same dark\nmatter halo.

As a\nresult, measurements on these scales yield information about the processes\nresponsible for fuelling super- massive black holes. At high redshifts, our\nmodels predict that quasars of fixed luminosity are located in less massive\nhalos than at low redshift. They are therefore less biased relative to galaxies\nof given luminosity or stellar mass. We have used the simulations to calculate\nthe evolution of the quasar auto- correlation function.

In the\ncontext of curved spacetime, D becomes a spinning disk of charge and mass\nrepresenting the singularity of the Kerr-Newman solution.

We compare solutions obtained in two very\ndifferent ways. One method uses a zero mode analysis to make an Ansatz which\nmakes it possible to solve the full non-linear supergravity equations. The\nother method utilises T-duality techniques to turn on the fields on the brane.\nTo be specific, in eleven dimensions we show the equivalence for the (M2,M5)\nbound state, or equivalently an M5-brane in a C_3 field, where we also consider\nthe (MW,M2,M2',M5) solution, which can be obtained from the (M2,M5) bound state\nby a boost. In ten dimensions we show the equivalence for the ((F,D1),D3) bound\nstate as well as the bound states of (p,q) 5-branes with lower dimensional\nbranes in type IIB, corresponding to D3-branes in B_2 and C_2 fields and (p,q)\n5-branes in B_2, C_2 and C_4 fields. We also comment on the recently proposed\nV-duality related to infinitesimally boosted solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2001 13:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

RNA, proteins, or similar organic molecules polymerized in a\ndehydrated carbon-rich environment, on surfaces in a carbon-rich environment,\nor in another environment where polymerization occurs. These polymers\nsubsequently entered an aqueous environment where they folded into compact\nstructures. It is argued that the folding of randomly generated polymers such\nas RNA or proteins in water tends to partition the folded polymer into domains\nwith hydrophobic cores and matching shapes to minimize energy. In the aqueous\nenvironment, hydrolysis or other reactions fragmented the compact structures\ninto two or more matching molecules, occasionally producing simple living\nsystems, also known as autocatalytic sets of molecules. It is argued that the\nhydrolysis of folded polymers such as RNA or proteins is not random. The\nhydrophobic cores of the domains are rarely bisected due to the energy\nrequirements in water. Hydrolysis preferentially fragments the folded polymers\ninto pieces with complementary structures and chemical affinities. Thus the\nprobability of producing a system of matched, interacting molecules in\nprebiotic chemistry is much higher than usually estimated. Environments where\nthis process may occur are identified.
