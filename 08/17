Intracluster X-ray\nemission is found to be centered 4.3 +/- 1.3 arcsec east and 3.5(-0.6,+1.3)\narcsec north of image B, nearer than previous estimates. Its spectrum can be\nmodeled well with a thermal plasma model consistent with the emission\noriginating from a cluster at a redshift of 0.36. Our best-fit estimates of the\ncluster temperature of T_e = 2.09(-0.54,+0.83) keV (90 percent confidence) and\nmass distribution of the cluster are used to derive the convergence parameter\nkappa, the ratio of the cluster surface mass density to the critical density\nrequired for lensing. We estimate the convergence parameter at the location of\nthe lensed images A and B to be kappa_A = 0.22(+0.14,-0.07) and kappa_B =\n0.21(+0.12,-0.07), respectively (90 percent confidence levels). The observed\ncluster center, mass distribution and convergence parameter kappa provide\nadditional constraints to lens models of this system.

What makes MgB2 so special? Its high\nTc, simple crystal structure, large coherence lengths, high critical current\ndensities and fields, transparency of grain boundaries to current promises that\nMgB2 will be a good material for both large scale applications and electronic\ndevices. During the last seven month, MgB2 has been fabricated in various\nforms, bulk, single crystals, thin films, tapes and wires. The largest critical\ncurrent densities >10MA/cm2 and critical fields 40T are achieved for thin\nfilms. The anisotropy ratio inferred from upper critical field measurements is\nstill to be resolved, a wide range of values being reported, between 1.2 and 9.\nAlso there is no consensus about the existence of a single anisotropic or\ndouble energy gap. One central issue is whether or not MgB2 represents a new\nclass of superconductors, being the tip of an iceberg who awaits to be\ndiscovered. Up to date MgB2 holds the record of the highest Tc in its class.\nHowever, the discovery of superconductivity in MgB2 revived the interest in\nnon-oxides and initiated a search for superconductivity in related materials,\nseveral compounds being already announced to become superconductive: TaB2,\nBeB2.75, C-S composites, and the elemental B under pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2001 21:40:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2001 20:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As quantified by the parameter $\\alpha$, this\nmethod (i) enables identification of the time scales over which noise dominates\nthe time series and (ii) characterizes the temporal range of correlations in\nthe time series. The more common spectral analysis method is also used to\nassess the data and its results are compared with those from detrended\nfluctuation analysis method. The assumption that measurements should have\ncertain scaling properties allows the quality of the measurements to be\ncharacterized. The additional assumption that the scaling properties of the\nmeasurements of an atmospheric quantity are preserved in a useful retrieval\nprovides a means for evaluating the retrieval itself. Applying these two\nassumptions to microwave radiometer measurements and retrievals demonstrates\nthree points. First, the retrieved water vapor path during cloudy-sky periods\ncan be dominated by noise on shorter than ~30~min time scales\n($\\alpha$-exponent = 0.1) and exhibits no scaling behavior at longer time\nscales. However, correlations in the brightness temperatures and liquid water\npath retrievals are found to be consistent with a power-law behavior for time\nscales up to 3 hr with an $\\alpha$-exponent equal to approximately 0.3, as in\nother geophysical phenomena. Second, clear-sky, moist atmospheres show the\nexpected scaling for both measurements and retrievals of the water vapor path.\nThird, during clear-sky, dry atmospheric days, instrument noise from the 31.4\nGHz channel compromises the quality of the water vapor path retrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2001 13:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
