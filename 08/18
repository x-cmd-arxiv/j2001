Due to light travel time\neffects these clouds probe the activity of Sgr A* at different times in the\npast depending on their position relative to the GC and the observer. In this\npaper we combine results of recent ASCA observations along the Galactic plane,\nproviding upper limits for the scattered flux in the 4-10 keV range produced in\na given direction, with data from CO surveys of the same regions. These CO\nsurveys map the position and mass of the molecular gas which the GMCs are made\nup of. Demanding the scattered flux to be not larger than the observed one,\nthis data enables us to derive upper limits for the 4-10 keV luminosity of Sgr\nA* at certain times during the last 40.000 years down to about 8*10^40 erg/s.\nAt other times the limits are less tight, of the order of 10^41-10^42 erg/s.\nThe more extended and continuous HI distribution in the Galactic disk, which\nalso scatters the radiation emitted by Sgr A*, allows us to extend the time\ncoverage further into the past, back to about 110.000 years, albeit the limits\nare becoming less tight. We thereby can rule out a long term X-ray activity\nphase of Sgr A* at one per cent of its Eddington level ending less than about\n80.000 years ago. The limits presented in this paper can be improved by\nobservations of emission in the fluorescent iron K_alpha-line.

They\ntentatively interpret these unresolved events as due to microlensing of\nbackground bulge stars by free-floating planets in M22. I show that if these\nspike events are due to microlensing, the lensing objects are unlikely to be\nassociated with M22, and unlikely to be part of a smoothly distributed Galactic\npopulation. Thus either there happens to be a massive, dark cluster of planets\nalong our line-of-sight to M22, or the spike events are not due to\nmicrolensing. The lensing planets cannot be bound to stars in the core of M22:\nif they were closer than 8 AU, the lensing influence of the parent star would\nhave been detectable. Moreover, in the core of M22, all planets with\nseparations > 1 AU would have been ionized by random stellar encounters. Most\nunbound planets would have escaped the core via evaporation which\npreferentially affects such low-mass objects. Bound or free-floating planets\ncan exist in the outer halo of M22; however, for reasonable assumptions, the\nmaximum optical depth to such a population falls short of the observed optical\ndepth, tau ~ 3x10^{-6}, by a factor of 5-10. Therefore, if real, these events\nrepresent the detection of a significant free-floating Galactic planet\npopulation. The optical depth to these planets is comparable to and mutually\nexclusive from the optical depth to resolved events measured by microlensing\nsurvey collaborations toward the bulge, and thus implies a similar additional\nmass of lensing objects.
