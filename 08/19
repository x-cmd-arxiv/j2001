The orbifold fixed planes are dual to stacks of D6\nbranes, the M9 planes are dual to O8 orientifold planes accompanied by D8\nbranes, and the intersections are dual to brane junctions. We engineer several\njunction types which lead to distinct patterns of 7D/10D gauge field locking,\n7D symmetry breaking and/or local 6D fields. Another aspect of brane\nengineering is putting the junctions together; sometimes, the combined effect\nis rather spectacular from the HW point of view and the quantum numbers of some\ntwisted states have to `bounce' off both ends of the eleventh dimension before\ntheir heterotic identity becomes clear. Some models involve D6/O8 junctions\nwhere the string coupling diverges towards the orientifold plane. We use the\nheterotic-HW-I' duality to predict what should happen at such junctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2001 14:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

In other words, God not\nonly plays dice in physics, but even in pure mathematics, in logic, in the\nworld of pure reason. Sometimes mathematical truth is completely random and has\nno structure or pattern that we will ever be able to understand.

The heats of formation determined using W2\ntheory are: \\hof(HCCH) = 54.48 kcal/mol, \\hof(HCCF) = 25.15 kcal/mol,\n\\hof(FCCF) = 1.38 kcal/mol, \\hof(HCCCl) = 54.83 kcal/mol, \\hof(ClCCCl) = 56.21\nkcal/mol, and \\hof(FCCCl) = 28.47 kcal/mol. Enthalpies of hydrogenation and\ndestabilization energies relative to acetylene were obtained at the W1 level of\ntheory. So doing we find the following destabilization order for acetylenes:\nFCCF $>$ ClCCF $>$ HCCF $>$ ClCCCl $>$ HCCCl $>$ HCCH. By a combination of W1\ntheory and isodesmic reactions, we show that the generally accepted heat of\nformation of 1,2-dichloroethane should be revised to -31.8$\\pm$0.6 kcal/mol, in\nexcellent agreement with a very recent critically evaluated review.
