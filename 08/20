Then, we discuss Poisson structures of TM which\nhave a graded restriction to the fiberwise polynomial algebra; they must be\np-related (p is the projection of TM onto M) with a Poisson structure on M.\nFurthermore, we define transversal Poisson structures of a foliation, and\ndiscuss bivector fields of TM which produce graded brackets on the fiberwise\npolynomial algebra, and are transversal Poisson structures of the foliation by\nfibers. Finally, such bivector fields are produced by a process of horizontal\nlifting of Poisson structures from M to TM via connections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2001 09:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\ncontrast with the adiabatic approximation, we find correlations between faster\nand slower elements when the differences in the time scales of the elements lie\nwithin a certain range. For such correlations to occur, three features are\nessential: strong correlations among the elements allowing for both\nsynchronization and desynchronization, bifurcation in the dynamics of the\nfastest element by the change of its control parameter, and the cascade\npropagation of the bifurcation. The relevance of our results to biological\nmemory is briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2001 11:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
