Numerically, we find for a\nwide range of boundary conditions that ridges buckle when our forcing has\nincreased their elastic energy by 20% over their resting state value.

In this type of pinning\ngeometry, a change in the periodicity and shape of the minima in the\nmagnetoresistance occurs for magnetic fields exceeding a certain threshold\nvalue. This has been explained recently in terms of a reconfiguration\ntransition of the vortex lattice due to an increasing vortex-vortex interaction\nwith increasing magnetic field. In this picture the dominating elastic energy\nat high fields forces the vortex lattice to form a square symmetry rather than\nbeing commensurate to the rectangular geometry of the pinning array.

Although the denaturation and unzipping\ntransitions are thermodynamically first order, they do exhibit critical\nfluctuations in some of their properties. For instance, the loop size\ndistribution decays algebraically at the transition and the length of the\ndenaturated end segment diverges as the transition is approached.

Its physical origin remains\ncontroversial even though it is perhaps the best-documented sequence modulation\nof DNA structure. We report here the results of comparative theoretical and\nexperimental studies of bending dynamics in 35-mer DNA fragments. This length\nappears large enough for the curvature to be distinguished by gel\nelectrophoresis. Two DNA fragments, with identical base pair composition, but\ndifferent sequences are compared. In the first one, a single A-tract motif was\nfour times repeated in phase with the helical screw whereas the second sequence\nwas \"random\". Both calculations and experiments indicate that the A-tract DNA\nis distinguished by the large static curvature and characteristic bending\ndynamics, suggesting that the computed effect corresponds to the experimental\nphenomenon. The results poorly agree with earlier views that attributed a\ndecisive role in DNA bending to sequence specific base pair stacking or binding\nof solvent counterions, but lend additional support to the hypothesis of a\ncompressed frustrated state of the backbone as the principal physical cause of\nthe static curvature. We discuss the possible ways of experimental verification\nof this hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2001 14:18:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2001 10:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
