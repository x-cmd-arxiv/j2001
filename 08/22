The mean\npolarization at 7660 A is 1.60% at 81.6 deg, or 0.6% at 139 deg if an estimate\nof the interstellar polarization is subtracted. The intrinsic polarization\npoints to an asymmetric geometry of the circumstellar or circumbinary\nenvironment while the 139 deg intrinsic position angle traces the axis of\nsymmetry of the system and is perpendicular to the position angle of the\noutflow cavity. The polarization and its position angle are clearly variable,\nat all wavelengths, and on time scales of hours, days, months, and years.\nStochastic variability is accompanied by periodic variations caused by the\norbital motion of the stars in their dusty environment. These periodic\npolarimetric variations are the first phased-locked ones detected for a\npre-main sequence binary. The variations are not simply double-periodic (seen\ntwice per orbit) but include single-periodic (seen once per orbit) and\nhigher-order variations. The presence of single-periodic variations could be\ndue to non equal mass stars, the presence of dust grains, an asymmetric\nconfiguration of the circumstellar or circumbinary material, or the\neccentricity of the orbit. MWC 1080 is an eclipsing binary with primary and\nsecondary eclipses occurring at phases 0.0 and 0.55. The signatures of the\neclipses are seen in the polarimetric observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2001 22:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We have studied in detail the\ndependence of these effects on the physical (i.e. temperature and optical\ndepth) and geometrical (i.e. inclination angle) parameters of the corona,\nconcentrating on the slab geometry . Due to the smoothing and shifting towards\nhigh energies of the comptonized reflection hump, the main effects on the\nemerging spectra appear above 100 keV.

The general features of the Stokes\noperators are illustrated by evaluation of their means and variances for a\nrange of simple polarization states. Some of the examples show polarization\nsqueezing, in which the variances of one or more Stokes parameters are smaller\nthan the coherent-state value. The main object of the paper is the application\nof these concepts to bright squeezed light. It is shown that a light beam\nformed by interference of two orthogonally-polarized quadrature-squeezed beams\nexhibits squeezing in some of the Stokes parameters. Passage of such a primary\npolarization-squeezed beam through suitable optical components generates a pair\nof polarization-entangled light beams with the nature of a two-mode squeezed\nstate. The use of pairs of primary polarization-squeezed light beams leads to\nsubstantially increased entanglement and to the generation of EPR-entangled\nlight beams. The important advantage of these nonclassical polarization states\nfor quantum communication is the possibility of experimentally determining all\nof the relevant conjugate variables of both squeezed and entangled fields using\nonly linear optical elements followed by direct detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2001 07:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
