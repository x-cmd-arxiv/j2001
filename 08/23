These\ninstabilities remain latent in a straight infinitely long chain, because the\nbending of such a chain would require an infinite energy.

The buckling instability is responsible, in particular, for the\nlarge-amplitude localized bending waves which accompany the nonlinear modes\npropagating along the chain. In the case of the collapse instability, the chain\nfolds into a compact three-dimensional coil. The viscous damping of the aqueous\nenvironment only slows down the folding of the chain, but does not stop it even\nfor a large damping.

This result is a reduction from the computational problem of\ninverting a one-way function to the problem of predicting a particular bit\nassociated with that function. We show that the quantum version of the\nreduction -- between quantum one-way functions and quantum hard-predicates --\nis quantitatively more efficient than the known classical version. Roughly\nspeaking, if the one-way function acts on n-bit strings then the overhead in\nthe reduction is by a factor of O(n/epsilon^2) in the classical case but only\nby a factor of O(1/epsilon) in the quantum case, where 1/2 + epsilon is the\nprobability of predicting the hard-predicate. Moreover, we prove via a lower\nbound that, in a black-box framework, the classical version of the reduction\ncannot have overhead less than order n/epsilon^2.\n  We also show that, using this reduction, a quantum bit commitment scheme that\nis perfectly binding and computationally concealing can be obtained from any\nquantum one-way permutation. This complements a recent result by Dumais, Mayers\nand Salvail, where the bit commitment scheme is perfectly concealing and\ncomputationally binding. We also show how to perform qubit commitment by a\nsimilar approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2001 18:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
