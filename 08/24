Radial\nvelocities of the WD, combined with ground-based measurements of the dK\nvelocities, eclipse timings, and a determination of the dK star's rotational\nvelocity, yield dynamical masses for the components of M(WD)=0.84 and\nM(dK)=0.93 Msun.

The\nradius of the dK component is 18% larger than that of a normal Hyades dwarf of\nthe same mass.

The\nabundances are derived from spectrum synthesis, using both LTE and non-LTE\ncalculations. As found in almost all previous studies of OB stars, the average\nabundances are slightly below solar, by about 0.1 to 0.3 dex. In the case of\noxygen, even with the recently derived low solar abundances the OB stars are\ncloser to, but still below, the solar value. Results for the 9 Cep OB2 members\nin this sample can be combined with results published previously for 8 Cep OB2\nstars with low projected rotational velocities to yield the most complete set\nof abundances, to date, for this particular association. These abundances\nprovide a clear picture of both the general chemical and individual stellar\nevolution that has occurred within this association. By placing the Cep OB2\nstars studied in an HR diagram we identify the presence of two distinct age\nsubgroups, with both subgroups having quite uniform chemical abundances. Two\nstars are found in the older subgroup that show significant N/O overabundances,\nwith both stars being two of the most massive, the most evolved, and most\nrapidly rotating of the members studied in Cep OB2. These characteristics of\nincreased N abundances being tied to high mass, rapid rotation, and an evolved\nphase are those predicted from models of rotating stars which undergo\nrotationally driven mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2001 15:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
