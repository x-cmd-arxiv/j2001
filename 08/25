A trace of a memory system satisfies sequential\nconsistency if there exists a total order of all memory events in the trace\nthat is both consistent with the total order at each processor and has the\nproperty that every read event to a location returns the value of the last\nwrite to that location.\n  Descriptions of shared-memory systems are typically parameterized by the\nnumber of processors, the number of memory locations, and the number of data\nvalues.
