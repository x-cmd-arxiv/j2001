Finding the right\npiece of information can, at times, be extremely time-consuming, if not\nimpossible. So-called Grids have been proposed to facilitate LHC computing and\nmany groups have embarked on studies of data replication, data migration and\nnetworking philosophies. Other aspects such as the role of 'middleware' for\nGrids are emerging as requiring research. This paper positions the need for\nappropriate middleware that enables users to resolve physics queries across\nmassive data sets. It identifies the role of meta-data for query resolution and\nthe importance of Information Grids for high-energy physics analysis rather\nthan just Computational or Data Grids. This paper identifies software that is\nbeing implemented at CERN to enable the querying of very large collaborating\nHEP data-sets, initially being employed for the construction of CMS detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2001 13:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

On the other\nhand, the network model of quantum computation cannot explain all ways of\nprocessing quantum information possible with the one-way quantum computer. In\nthis paper, two examples of the non-network character of the one-way quantum\ncomputer are given. First, circuits in the Clifford group can be performed in a\nsingle time step.
