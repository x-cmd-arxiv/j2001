Using a sub-sample of Seyfert galaxies,\nwhich have black-hole mass estimates from both reverberation mapping and\nstellar velocity dispersions, we investigate the geometry of the AGN broad-line\nregion (BLR). It is demonstrated that a model in which the orbits of the\nline-emitting material have a flattened geometry is favoured over randomly\norientated orbits. Using this model we investigate the M_{bh}-L_{bulge}\nrelation for a combined 90-object sample, consisting of the AGN plus a sample\nof 18 nearby inactive elliptical galaxies with dynamical black-hole mass\nmeasurements. It is found that, for all reasonable mass-to-light ratios, the\nM_{bh}-L_{bulge} relation is equivalent to a linear scaling between bulge and\nblack-hole mass. The best-fitting normalization of the M_{bh}-M_{bulge}\nrelation is found to be M_{bh}=0.0012M_{bulge}, in agreement with recent\nblack-hole mass studies based on stellar velocity dispersions. Furthermore, the\nscatter around the M_{bh}-L_{bulge} relation for the full sample is found to be\nsignificantly smaller than has been previously reported (Delta \\log M_{bh}=0.39\ndex). Finally, using the nearby inactive elliptical galaxy sample alone, it is\nshown that the scatter in the M_{bh}-L_{bulge} relation is only 0.33 dex,\ncomparable to that of the M_{bh}-sigma relation. These results indicate that\nreliable black-hole mass estimates can be obtained for high redshift galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2001 16:08:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2001 18:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

In this paper we\nstudy how ram pressure stripping (RPS) and small starburst induced by a minor\nmerger affect colors, star formation rates, and morphologies of cluster\ngalaxies. We find that the RPS is not important for colors and SFRs of galaxies\nin the cluster core if star formation time-scale is properly chosen, because\nthe star formation is sufficiently suppressed by consumption of the cold gas in\nthe disks. Then observed color and SFR gradients can be reproduced without the\nRPS. The small starburst triggered by a minor merger hardly affects the SFRs\nand colors of the galaxies as well. We also examine whether these two processes\ncan resolve the known problem that the major merger-driven bulge formation\nscenario predict too few galaxies of intermediate bulge-to-total luminosity\nratio (B/T) in clusters. When the minor burst is taken into account, the\nintermediate B/T population is increased and the observed morphology gradients\nin clusters are successfully reproduced. When the minor burst is considered,\nthe RPS also plays an important role in formation of the intermediate B/T\ngalaxies. We present redshift evolution of morphological fractions predicted by\nour models. The predicted number ratios of the intermediate B/T galaxies to the\nbulge-dominated galaxies show nearly flat or slightly increasing trends with\nincreasing redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2001 06:10:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2003 19:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Our generalized RPA\ntheory explicitly incorporates the two-step resonance process where an electron\nfrom the filled valence band is first excited by the incident photon into the\nconduction band before an electron from the conduction band falls back into the\nvalence band emitting the scattered photon. We show that when the incident\nphoton energy is close to a resonance energy, i.e. the valence-to-conduction\nband gap of the semiconductor structure, the Raman scattering spectral weight\nat single particle excitation energies may be substantially enhanced even for\nlong wavelength excitations, and may become comparable to the spectral weight\nof collective charge density excitations (plasmon).
