Clues about how and when was the intergalactic\nmedium ionized can be read off the UV emission spectrum of GRB explosions from\nthe first generation of stars. The existence of intergalactic and galactic\nstars can be inferred from their gravitational microlensing effect on GRB\nafterglows. Prior to reionization, quasars should be surrounded by a halo of\nscattered Lyman-alpha radiation which probes the neutral intergalactic medium\n(IGM) around them. The situation is analogous to the appearance of a halo of\nscattered light around a street lamp which is embedded in a dense fog. Outflows\nfrom quasars magnetize the IGM at all redshifts. As a result, the shocks\nproduced by converging flows during the formation of large scale structure in\nthe IGM, accelerate electrons to relativistic energies and become visible in\nthe radio regime through their synchrotron emission and in the gamma-ray regime\nthrough their inverse-Compton scattering of the microwave background photons.\nDuring transient episodes of strong mergers, X-ray clusters should therefore\nappear as extended radio or gamma-ray sources on the sky.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2001 16:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

A first attempt at a\nnear-infrared classification scheme for T dwarfs is made, based on the\nstrengths of CH$_4$ and H$_2$O bands and the shapes of the 1.25, 1.6, and 2.1\n$\\micron$ flux peaks.

Besides the\nproblem of how such a large-scale magnetic field is generated, in this model\nthe jet suffers from the fatal long-wave mode kink magnetohydrodynamic\ninstability. In this paper we explore an alternative model: jet collimation by\nsmall-scale magnetic fields. These magnetic fields are assumed to be local,\nchaotic, tangled, but are dominated by toroidal components. Just as in the case\nof a large-scale toroidal magnetic field, we show that the ``hoop stress'' of\nthe tangled toroidal magnetic fields exerts an inward force which confines and\ncollimates the jet. The magnetic ``hoop stress'' is balanced either by the gas\npressure of the jet, or by the centrifugal force if the jet is spinning. Since\nthe length-scale of the magnetic field is small (< the cross-sectional radius\nof the jet << the length of the jet), in this model the jet does not suffer\nfrom the long-wave mode kink instability. Many other problems associated with\nthe large-scale magnetic field are also eliminated or alleviated for\nsmall-scale magnetic fields. Though it remains an open question how to generate\nand maintain the required small-scale magnetic fields in a jet, the scenario of\njet collimation by small-scale magnetic fields is favored by the current study\non disk dynamo which indicates that small-scale magnetic fields are much easier\nto generate than large-scale magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2001 15:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

All these states satisfy a unity resolution relation in\nthe C_{\\lambda}-extended oscillator Fock space (or in some subspace thereof).\nThey give rise to Bargmann representations of the latter, wherein the\ngenerators of the C_{\\lambda}-extended oscillator algebra are realized as\ndifferential-operator-valued matrices (or differential operators). The\nstatistical and squeezing properties of the new coherent states are\ninvestigated over a wide range of parameters and some interesting nonclassical\nfeatures are exhibited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2001 08:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
