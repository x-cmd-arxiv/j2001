Keck\nObservatory. These data allow a new quantitative test of the \"inside-out\"\ncollapse model previously proposed to explain molecular line profiles observed\ntoward this region. We find that the shape of the density profile is well\nmatched by the collapse model, but that the amount of extinction corresponds to\nlarger column densities than predicted. An unstable Bonnor-Ebert sphere with\ndimensionless outer radius xi_max=12.5+/-2.6 provides an equally good\ndescription of the density profile, and is indistinguishable from the collapse\nmodel over the range in radius sampled by the data. The bipolar outflow driven\nby the embedded YSO has an important effect on the extinction through the core,\nand modeling the outflow as a hollowed-out bipolar cone of constant opening\nangle provides a good match to theobservations. The complete exinction map is\nwell reproduced by a model that includes both infall and outflow, and an extra\n20% dispersion that likely results from residual turbulent motions. This fitted\nmodel has an infall radius of R_inf=26\"+/-3\"(0.031pc for 250pc distance), and\nan outflow cone semi-opening angle of alpha=41+/-2 degrees. The fitted infall\nradius is consistent with those derived from molecular line observations and\nsupports the inside-out collapse interpretation of the density structure. The\nfitted opening angle of the outflow is slightly larger than observed in CO\nemission, perhaps because the full extent of the outflow cone in CO becomes\nconfused with ambient core emission at low velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2001 17:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The possible transport mechanisms and the possible fates of the excess\nangular momentum are discussed, and it is argued that transport processes in\ndisks are probably not sufficient by themselves to solve the angular momentum\nproblem, while tidal interactions with other stars in forming binary or\nmultiple systems are likely to be of very general importance in redistributing\nangular momentum during the star formation process. Most, if not all, stars\nprobably form in binary or multiple systems, and tidal torques in these systems\ncan transfer much of the angular momentum from the gas around each forming star\nto the orbital motions of the companion stars. Tidally generated waves in\ncircumstellar disks may contribute to the overall redistribution of angular\nmomentum. Stars may gain much of their mass by tidally triggered bursts of\nrapid accretion, and these bursts could account for some of the most energetic\nphenomena of the earliest stages of stellar evolution, such as jet-like\noutflows. If tidal interactions are indeed of general importance,\nplanet-forming disks may often have a more chaotic and violent early evolution\nthan in standard models, and shock heating events may be common.

Even though the\nlow exposure of this observation limits our ability to constrain the\ntemperature jump across both edges, we show that the northern edge is likely to\nbe a ``cold front'' similar to others observed recently by Chandra in the\nclusters A2142, A3667, RX J1720.1+2638, and A2256. The observed cold front is\nmost likely produced by the motion, from south to north, of a group-size dark\nmatter halo. The most natural explanation for the presence of this observed\nmoving subclump is that MS 1455.0+2232 is a merger cluster in the very last\nstage before it becomes fully relaxed. This scenario, however, appears to be\nunlikely as the cluster shows no further sign of ongoing merger. Moreover, it\nis not clear if a massive cooling flow could have survived this kind of merger.\nWe propose an alternative scenario in which, as for RX J1720.1+2638, MS\n1455.0+2232 is the result of the hierarchical collapse of two co-located\ndensity perturbations, the first a group-scale perturbation collapse followed\nby a second cluster-scale perturbation collapse that surrounded, but did not\ndestroy, the first.

It has been suggested by many authors that the\nPS mass function agrees well with the mass function given by $N$-body\nsimulations, while many too simple assumptions are contained in the formalism.\nIn order to understand why the PS formalism works well we consider the\nfollowing three effects on the mass function: the filtering effect of the\ndensity fluctuation field, the peak ansatz in which objects collapse around\ndensity maxima, and the spatial correlation of density contrasts within a\nregion of a collapsing halo because objects have non-zero finite volume.\nAccording to the method given by Yano, Nagashima & Gouda (YNG) who used an\nintegral formula proposed by Jedamzik, we resolve the missing link in the PS\nformalism, taking into account the three effects. While YNG showed that the\neffect of the spatial correlation alters the original PS mass function, in this\npaper, we show that the filtering effect almost cancels out the effect of the\nspatial correlation and that the original PS is almost recovered by combining\nthese two effects, particularly in the case of the top-hat filter. On the other\nhand, as for the peak ansatz, the resultant mass functions are changed\ndramatically and not in agreement especially at low-mass tails in the cases of\nthe Gaussian and the sharp $k$-space filters.

For\ntwo fermion annihilation processes initial state radiation is a definable,\ngauge-invariant, concept and one has general tools to deal with it; the\nstructure function approach and also the parton-shower method. However, when\none tries to apply the algorithm to four-fermion processes that include\nnon-annihilation channels a problem is faced: is it still possible to include\nQED corrections by making use of the standard tools? A systematization is\nattempted of several, recently proposed, algorithms. In particular, it is shown\nthat starting from the exponentiation of soft photons one can still derive a\ndescription of QED radiation in terms of structure functions, i.e. the kernel\nfor the hard scattering is convoluted with generalized structure functions\nwhere each of them is no longer function of one scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2001 15:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Conventional scaling of traveling wave traveling wave\nlinacs with frequency scales the cell dimensions with l. Because Q scales as\nl1/2, the length of the structures scale not linearly but as l3/2 in order to\npreserve the attenuation through each structure. For NLC we chose not to follow\nthis scaling from the SLAC S-band linac to its fourth harmonic at X-band. We\nwanted to increase the length of the structures to reduce the number of\ncouplers and waveguide drives which can be a significant part of the cost of a\nmicrowave linac. Furthermore, scaling the iris size of the disk-loaded\nstructures gave unacceptably high short range dipole wakefields. Consequently,\nwe chose to go up a factor of about 5 in average group velocity and length of\nthe structures, which increases the power fed to each structure by the same\nfactor and decreases the short range dipole wakes by a similar factor.\nUnfortunately, these longer (1.8 m) structures have not performed nearly as\nwell in high gradient tests as the short structures. We believe we have at\nleast a partial understanding of the reason and will discuss it below. We are\nnow studying two types of short structures with large apertures with moderately\ngood efficiency including: 1) traveling wave structures with the group velocity\nlowered by going to large phase advance per period with bulges on the iris, 2)\npi mode standing wave structures\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2001 21:15:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
