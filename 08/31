Unlike other\nshort period exoplanets, it maintains a substantial orbital eccentricity,\ne_1=0.079+/- 0.008, in spite of efficient tidal damping. This is a consequence\nof its secular interactions with HD 83443c whose orbital eccentricity\ne_2=0.42+/-0.06. Dissipation, associated with tides the star raises in the\ninner planet, removes energy but not angular momentum from its orbit, while\nsecular interactions transfer angular momentum but not energy from the inner to\nthe outer planet's orbit. The outward transfer of angular momentum decreases\nthe tidal decay rate of the inner planet's orbital eccentricity while\nincreasing that of the outer planet. The alignment of the apsides of the\nplanets' orbits is another consequence of tidal and secular interactions. In\nthis state the ratio of their orbital eccentricities, e_1/e_2, depends upon the\nsecular perturbations the planets exert on each other and on additional\nperturbations that enhance the inner planet's precession rate.

In conjunction with previously published\nradio continuum (6 and 20 cm) and H alpha data, we find spatial correlations\nbetween various ISM components in that all components of the ISM are present in\nthe disk-halo features (except for CO for which there is insufficient spatial\ncoverage). The HI features extend to about 7 kpc above the plane. In one case,\na loop is detected in position-velocity space, and are also observed over a\nlarge velocity range. This implies that the disk-halo features represent\nexpanding supershells. However, the shells may be incomplete and partially\nopen-topped, suggesting that we are observing the breakup of the supershells as\nthey traverse the disk-halo interface. There is some evidence for acceleration\nwith z height and both redshifted and blueshifted velocities are present,\nalthough the gas which is lagging with respect to galactic rotation dominates.\nThe radio continuum spectral index is flatter around the shell rims, suggesting\nthat shocks may be important in these regions (thermal contribution can not\naccount for this flattening). The H alpha emission is located interior to the\nHI. For feature F3, the H alpha emission forms the interior \"skin\" of the HI\nshell, yet there appears to be a minimum of in-disk star formation immediately\nbelow the feature. We present a picture of a \"typical\" HI supershell which\naccelerates and breaks up through the disk-halo interface. Such a feature is\nlikely internally generated via an energetic event in the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2001 13:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The exclusive energy spectra of\n$\\alpha$-particles emitted from the $^{28}$Si + $^{28}$Si compound system are\ngenerally well reproduced by Monte Carlo calculations using spin-dependent\nlevel densities.
