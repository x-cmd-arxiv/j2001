In this review I will first discuss some intriguing observations of\nglobular cluster sources in M31, then move outside the Local Group and\nsummarise the observational properties of sources in several spiral galaxies\n(both bulge dominated and disk dominated). The X-ray colors and variability\ncharacteristics suggest that most of these sources are accreting binaries. High\nmass X-ray binaries are formed preferentially in disk galaxies.

The accelerator must take the beams from ~100 MeV to 2 TeV within the\nmuon lifetime (2.2 x 10**(-6) E(mu)/m(mu) uS), while compressing bunches of\n10**(12) muons from m to cm bunch lengths. Linac, recirculating linac, and very\nrapid-cycling synchrotron approaches are studied. Multiple recirculating linac\napproaches are matched to the muon lifetime and appear readily feasible.\nRapid-cycling approaches require innovations in magnet designs and layouts, but\ncould be much more affordable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2001 03:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
