Here we present new theoretical predictions for several UV BELs.

Among the lines we consider, N III] 1750/O III]\n1664, N V 1240/(C IV 1549 + O VI 1034) and N V/He II 1640 are the most robust\ndiagnostics. We argue, in particular, that the average N V BEL is not dominated\nby scattered Ly-alpha photons from a broad absorption line wind. We then\ncompare our calculated line ratios with observations from the literature. The\nresults support earlier claims that the gas-phase metallicities near quasars\nare typically near or several times above the solar value. We conclude that\nquasar activity is preceded by, or coeval with, an episode of rapid and\nextensive star formation in the surrounding galactic (or proto-galactic)\nnuclei.

Toward the end of the\nsimulation, at 600 Myr, the displaced gas begins to fall back toward the core,\nand the subsequent turbulence is very efficient at mixing the low and high\nentropy gas. The result is that the cooling flow is disrupted for up to $\\sim\n50$ Myr after the injection of energy ceases. Thus, this mechanism provides a\nvery efficient method for regulating cooling flows, if the injection events\noccur with a 1:1 duty cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2001 10:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

These results are interpreted with the aid of a crude chemical\nmodel which predicts the abundances of these species as a function of radius in\na spherically symmetric model with radial density distribution inferred from\nthe observations of dust emission at millimeter wavelengths and dust absorption\nin the infrared. Our main observational finding is that the N(N2D+)/N(N2H+)\ncolumn density ratio is of order 0.2 towards the L1544 dust peak as compared to\nN(DCO+)/N(HCO+) = 0.04. We conclude that this result as well as the general\nfinding that N2H+ and N2D+ correlate well with the dust is caused by CO being\ndepleted to a much higher degree than molecular nitrogen in the high density\ncore of L1544. Depletion also favors deuterium enhancement and thus N2D+, which\ntraces the dense and highly CO-depleted core nucleus, is much more enhanced\nthan DCO+. Our models do not uniquely define the chemistry in the high density\ndepleted nucleus of L1544 but they do suggest that the ionization degree is a\nfew times 10^{-9} and that the ambipolar diffusion time scale is locally\nsimilar to the free fall time. It seems likely that the lower limit which one\nobtains to ionization degree by summing all observable molecular ions is not a\ngreat underestimate of the true ionization degree.

No additional noise arises from the\ntest masses' initial quantum state or from reduction of the test-mass state due\nto measurement of the interferometer output or from the uncertainty principle\nassociated with the test-mass state. Two features of interferometers are\ncentral to these conclusions: (i) The interferometer output (the photon number\nflux N(t) entering the final photodetector) commutes with itself at different\ntimes in the Heisenberg Picture, [N(t), N(t')] = 0, and thus can be regarded as\nclassical. (ii) This number flux is linear in the test-mass initial position\nand momentum operators x_o and p_o, and those operators influence the measured\nphoton flux N(t) in manners that can easily be removed by filtering -- e.g., in\nmost interferometers, by discarding data near the test masses' 1 Hz swinging\nfreqency. The test-mass operators x_o and p_o contained in the unfiltered\noutput N(t) make a nonzero contribution to the commutator [N(t), N(t')]. That\ncontribution is cancelled by a nonzero commutation of the photon shot noise and\nradiation-pressure noise, which also are contained in N(t). This cancellation\nof commutators is responsible for the fact that it is possible to derive an\ninterferometer's standard quantum limit from test-mass considerations, and\nindependently from photon-noise considerations.

Furthermore it is argued\nthat this exponential decrease of the detector efficiency required to close the\ndetection loophole is almost optimal. This argument is based on a close\nconnection that exists between closing the detection loophole and the amount of\nclassical communication required to simulate quantum correlation when the\ndetectors are perfect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2001 13:50:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2001 12:40:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2001 09:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

The start viewpoint\nwas the following: All the phenomena, which we observe in the quantum world,\nshould reflect structural properties of the real space. Thus the scale 10^{-28}\ncm at which three fundamental interactions (electromagnetic, weak, and strong)\nintersect has been treated as the size of a building block of the space. The\nappearance of a massive particle is associated with a local deformation of the\ncellular space, i.e. deformation of a cell. The mechanics of a moving particle\nthat has been constructed is deterministic by its nature and shows that the\nparticle interacts with cells of the space creating elementary excitations\ncalled \"inertons\". The further study has disclosed that inertons are a\nsubstructure of the matter waves which are described by the orthodox wave\n\\psi-function formalism. The concept has allowed resolving the spin problem.\nThe theory, or more exactly, the existence of inertons, has been verified\nexperimentally: in rarefied gases, inerton clouds of atoms' electrons interact\nwith a strong laser pulse; in a solid, atom's inertons induce an additional\nharmonic potential that contributes to the interatomic interaction (metal\nspecimens and the KIO_3*HIO_3 crystal).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2001 15:52:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2001 11:10:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2001 16:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2002 09:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
