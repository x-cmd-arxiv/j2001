To achieve this purpose, we will first recall\nthe experimental constraints upon the Eddington-Robertson parameters gamma,\nbeta and the observational bounds for the perihelion advance of Mercury. A\nsecond point will address the values given, up to now, to the solar quadrupole\nmoment by several authors. Then, we will briefly comment why we use a recent\ntheoretical determination of the solar quadrupole moment, J2=(2.0 +/- 0.4)\n10^{-7}, which takes into account both surfacic and internal differential\nrotation, in order to compute the solar contribution to Mercury's perihelion\nadvance. Further on, combining bounds on gamma and J2 contributions, and taking\ninto account the observational data range for the perihelion shift, we will be\nable to give a range of values for beta.\n  Alternatively, taking into account the observed value of perihelion shift,\none can deduce a dynamical estimation of J2 in the setting of G.R. This point\nis important as it provides a solar model independent estimation that can be\nconfronted with other determinations of J2 based upon solar theory and solar\nobservations (oscillation data, oblateness...).\n  Finally, a glimpse at future satellite experiments will help us to understand\nhow stronger constraints upon the parameter space (gamma, beta, J2) as well as\na separation of the two contributions (J2, or purely relativistic) might be\nexpected in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2001 16:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Then we\napply this formalism to compute the energy transfer in the quasi-steady-state\nof two-dimensional MHD turbulence with large-scale kinetic forcing. The\ncomputation of energy fluxes and the energy transfer between different\nwavenumber shells is done using the data generated by the pseudo-spectral\ndirect numerical simulation. The picture of energy flux that emerges is quite\ncomplex---there is a forward cascade of magnetic energy, an inverse cascade of\nkinetic energy, a flux of energy from the kinetic to the magnetic field, and a\nreverse flux which transfers the energy back to the kinetic from the magnetic.\nThe energy transfer between different wavenumber shells is also complex---local\nand nonlocal transfers often possess opposing features, i.e., energy transfer\nbetween some wavenumber shells occurs from kinetic to magnetic, and between\nother wavenumber shells this transfer is reversed. The net transfer of energy\nis from kinetic to magnetic.

The latter model was established as a\ngeneralization of Turing computation. All this is not surprising since it is\nwell known that the physics of quantum field theory (which includes Einstein's\nspecial relativity) contains quantum mechanics which in turn contains classical\nmechanics. The unity of these computing models, which seem to have grown\nlargely independently, could shed new light into questions of computational\ncomplexity, into the central P (Polynomial time) versus NP (Non-deterministic\nPolynomial time) problem of computer science, and also into the description of\nNature by fundamental physics theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2001 03:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
