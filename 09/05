We first show that\nviscosity contrast does not affect the composition of the base lamellar phase\nin an unbounded geometry, and that it only couples weakly to long wavelength\nperturbations. A perturbative analysis is then presented to address the\nstability of uniform lamellar structures under long wavelength perturbations by\nself-consistently solving for the composition and velocity fields of the\nperturbations.

Motivated by our\nreinterpretation we suggest a modification of the DMRG which manifestly takes\naccount of the entanglement in a quantum system. This modified renormalization\nscheme is shown,in certain special cases, to preserve more entanglement in a\nquantum system than traditional numerical renormalization methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2001 01:45:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2002 18:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
