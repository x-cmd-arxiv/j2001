Their formation\ndepends on the quantity of matter accreted by the neutron star which, in turn,\nis limited by the mechanism of mass ejection from the binary. An efficient mass\nejection can avoid the formation of ultra-fast pulsars or their accretion\ninduced collapse to a black hole. We propose that significant reductions of the\nmass-transfer rate may cause the switch-on of a radio pulsar phase, whose\nradiation pressure may be capable of ejecting out of the system most of the\nmatter transferred by the companion. This can prevent, for long orbital periods\nand if a sufficiently fast spin has been reached, any further accretion, even\nif the original transfer rate is restored, thus limiting the minimum spin\nperiod attainable by the neutron star. We show that close systems (orbital\nperiods P_orb \\sim 1 hr are the only possible hosts for ultra-fast spinning\nneutron stars.

By numerically\nintegrating the two-electron Schroedinger equation in time, we find that for\ncertain values of the strength and frequency of the AC field we can cause the\nelectrons to be localised within the same dot, in spite of the Coulomb\nrepulsion between them. Reducing the system to an effective two-site model of\nHubbard type and applying Floquet theory leads to a detailed understanding of\nthis effect. This demonstrates the possibility of using appropriate AC fields\nto manipulate entangled states in mesoscopic devices on extremely short\ntimescales, which is an essential component of practical schemes for quantum\ninformation processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2001 17:39:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2001 17:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Hadronic matter is modeled in terms\nof its quark constituents by taking into account its internal flavor (u,d,s)\nand color (red, blue, green) degrees of freedom. Variational Monte-Carlo\nsimulations in three spatial dimensions are performed for the ground-state\nenergy of the system. The onset of the transition to strange matter is found to\nbe influenced by weak, yet not negligible, clustering correlations. The phase\ndiagram of the system displays an interesting structure containing both\ncontinuous and discontinuous phase transitions. Strange matter is found to be\nabsolutely stable in the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2001 15:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
