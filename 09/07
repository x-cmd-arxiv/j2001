In this framework the Standard\nModel fields are localized on D3-branes sitting on top of an orientifold\n3-plane. The transverse 6-dimensional space is a non-compact orbifold or a more\ngeneral conifold. The 4-dimensional gravity on D3-branes is reproduced due to\nthe 4-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert term induced at the quantum level. The\norientifold 3-plane plays a crucial role, in particular, without it the\nD3-brane world-volume theories would be conformal due to the tadpole\ncancellation. We point out that in some cases the 4-dimensional Planck scale is\ncontrolled by the size of certain relevant (as opposed to marginal) orbifold\nblow-ups. We can then have a scenario with the desirable 4-dimensional Planck\nscale, the string scale of order TeV, and the cross-over to 10-dimensional\ngravity around the present Hubble size.

We point out that the D7-brane gauge symmetry at the quantum\nlevel becomes part of the 4-dimensional gauge symmetry. We present an N=1\nsupersymmetric model with 3 chiral generations of quarks and leptons, where the\noriginal gauge group (which contains an SU(6) subgroup) can be Higgsed to\nobtain a Pati-Salam model with 3 chiral generations, the Pati-Salam Higgs\nfields required to break the gauge group further to that of the Standard Model,\nas well as the desired electroweak Higgs doublets. The superpotential in this\nmodel is such that we have precisely one heavy (top-like) generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2001 00:16:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2001 03:31:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2001 20:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Meanwhile it can be usefully applied to\nproblems where gravitation effects are negligible and domains of less exotic\nsize. The essence of this principle is that any physical system can be taken to\nbe either classical, placed in a D+1-dimensional spacetime, or\nquantum-mechanical, located in its D-dimensional boundary. For example, one\nbelieves that a hydrogen atom is a typical quantum system living in a\nfour-dimensional spacetime, but it can also be conceived as a classical system\nliving in a five-dimensional embracing spacetime. The subnuclear realm is more\nintricate since the gluon vacuum reveals two phases, the hadronic and plasma\nphases. They differ in energetics and symmetry. Moreover, the classical\nfour-dimensional picture is pertinent to the behavior of constituent quarks\nwhile the plasma phase is expected to be grasped by standard four-dimensional\nQCD. The relation between the holographic standpoint and the symmetry treatment\nof these two phases is outlined. Exact retarded solutions to the classical\nSU(N) four-dimensional Yang-Mills equations with the source composed of several\npoint-like colored particles is considered. Features of these solutions in the\nlarge-N limit provide insight into the gauge symmetries of two gluon vacua.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2001 05:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

If K is a fixed finite complex, Greg Arone has\nrecently given an explicit model for the Goodwillie tower of the functor\nsending a space X to the suspension spectrum \\Sigma^\\infty Map_T(K,X). Applying\na generalized homology theory h_* to this tower yields a spectral sequence, and\nthis will converge strongly to h_*(Map_T(K,X)) under suitable conditions, e.g.\nif h_* is connective and X is at least dim K connected. Even when the\nconvergence is more problematic, it appears the spectral sequence can still\nshed considerable light on h_*(Map_T(K,X)). Similar comments hold when a\ncohomology theory is applied. In this paper we study how various important\nnatural constructions on mapping spaces induce extra structure on the towers.\nThis leads to useful interesting additional structure in the associated\nspectral sequences. For example, the diagonal on Map_T(K,X) induces a\n`diagonal' on the associated tower. After applying any cohomology theory with\nproducts h^*, the resulting spectral sequence is then a spectral sequence of\ndifferential graded algebras. The product on the E_\\infty -term corresponds to\nthe cup product in h^*(Map_T(K,X)) in the usual way, and the product on the\nE_1-term is described in terms of group theoretic transfers.
