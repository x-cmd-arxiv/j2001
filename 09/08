In this\npaper we present a new counter-argument, based on the fact that a classical\nmeasurement reveals, not simply a pre-existing value, but pre-existing\nclassical information. In the MKC models measurements do not generally reveal\npre-existing classical information. Consequently, the Kochen-Specker theorem is\nnot nullified. We go on to prove a generalized version of the Kochen-Specker\ntheorem, applying to non-ideal quantum measurements. The theorem was inspired\nby the work of Simon et al and Larsson (SBZL). However, there is a loophole in\nSBZL's argument, which means that their result is invalid (operational\nnon-contextuality is not inconsistent with the empirical predictions of quantum\nmechanics).
