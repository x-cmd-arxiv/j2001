V348 Pup is the second SW Sex system (the first is V795 Herculis) which\nlies in the period gap. The spectra exhibit enhanced HeII 4686 emission,\nreminiscent of magnetic cataclysmic variables. The study of this emission line\ngives a primary velocity semi-amplitude of K1 ~= 100 km/s. We have also derived\nthe system parameters, obtaining: M1 ~= 0.65 Msun, M2 ~= 0.20 Msun (q ~= 0.31),\ni ~= 80 deg and K2 ~= 323 km/s. The spectroscopic behaviour of V348 Pup is very\nsimilar to that of V795 Her, with the exception that V348 Pup shows deep\neclipses. We have computed the ``0.5-absorption'' spectrum of both systems,\nobtaining spectra which resemble the absorption spectrum of a B0 V star. We\npropose that absorption in SW Sex systems can be produced by a vertically\nextended atmosphere which forms where the gas stream re-impacts the system,\neither at the accretion disc or at the white dwarf's magnetosphere (assuming a\nmagnetic scenario).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2001 02:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
