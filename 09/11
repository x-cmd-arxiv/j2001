In order for these models to match\nthe faint end of the luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio decreasing with\nluminosity as $L^{-0.5\\pm 0.06}$ is required. For a $\\Lambda$CDM model, the\nmass-to-light function has a minimum of $\\sim 100 h^{-1}_{75}$ in solar units\nin the $B$-band, corresponding to $\\sim 25%$ of the baryons in the form of\nstars, and this minimum occurs close to the luminosity of an $L^*$ galaxy.

This increase,\nhowever, is still below the cosmic variance limit of the primary anisotropies;\nat further small angular scales, secondary effects such as gravitational\nlensing and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect dominates the non-linear\nISW power spectrum.

We also detected no linear polarization in M81* at a level of\n0.1% implying that the source has a very high circular-to-linear polarization\nratio as found so far only in Sgr A*, the central radio source in our Galaxy.\nThis further supports the idea that M81* is a scaled-up version of Sgr A* and\nsuggests that the polarization properties are intrinsic to the two sources and\nare not caused by a foreground screen in the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2001 10:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The shortest orbital periods were chosen to have\ninitially unevolved secondaries, and the longest orbital period for each\nsecondary mass was taken to be just longer than the bifurcation period (16 - 22\nhr), beyond which systems evolve towards long orbital periods. These\ncalculations show that systems which start with evolved secondaries near the\nend or just after their main-sequence phase become ultra-compact systems with\nperiods as short as 7 min. These systems are excellent candidates for AM CVn\nstars. Using a standard BPS code, we show how the properties of CVs at the\nbeginning of mass transfer depend on the efficiency for common-envelope (CE)\nejection and the efficiency of magnetic braking. In our standard model, where\nCE ejection is efficient, some 10 per cent of all CVs have initially evolved\nsecondaries (with a central hydrogen abundance X_c < 0.4) and ultimately become\nultra-compact systems (implying a Galactic birthrate for AM CVn-like stars of\n10^{-3} yr^{-1}).

Firstly some results for the general case\nof an $m+1$-dimensional Lie group are derived: those commutators of the\nassociated Lie algebra involving the generator of the cyclic subgroup, $X_0$\nsay, are severely restricted and, in a suitably chosen basis, take a simple\nform.

The resulting\ntheorem is an extension of the Gottesman-Knill theorem to continuous variable\nquantum information. For a collection of harmonic oscillators, any quantum\nprocess that begins with unentangled Gaussian states, performs only\ntransformations generated by Hamiltonians that are quadratic in the canonical\noperators, and involves only measurements of canonical operators (including\nfinite losses) and suitable operations conditioned on these measurements can be\nsimulated efficiently on a classical computer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2001 04:18:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2002 05:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
