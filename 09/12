The images confirm the presence of a twisted jet with\ntwo sharp apparent bends of 90$^{\\circ}$ within two milliarcseconds of the\ncore, resembling a helix in projection. The observed twisted geometry could be\nthe result of precession of the jet inlet, but is more likely produced by\npressure gradients in the external medium through which the jet propagates.\nQuasi-stationary components are observed at the locations of the 90$^{\\circ}$\nbends, possibly produced by differential Doppler boosting. Identification of\ncomponents across epochs, since the earliest VLBI observations of this source\nin 1979.2, proves difficult due to the sometimes large time gaps between\nobservations. One possible identification suggests the existence of\nsuperluminal components following non--ballistic trajectories with velocities\nup to $11.6\\pm 0.6 h_{65}^{-1} c$. However, in images obtained after mid-1995,\ncomponents show a remarkable tendency to cluster near several jet positions,\nsuggesting a different scenario in which components have remained nearly\nstationary in time at least since mid-1995. Comparison with the earlier\npublished data, covering more than 19 years of observations, suggests a\nstriking qualitative change in the jet trajectory sometime between mid-1992 and\nmid-1995, with the twisted jet structure with stationary components becoming\napparent only at the later epochs. This would require a re-evaluation of the\nphysical parameters estimated for 0735+178, such as the observing viewing\nangle, the plasma bulk Lorentz factor, and those deduced from these.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2001 17:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
