We have compiled a homogeneous sample\nof radio-selected QSOs from the Parkes Catalogue and searched for damped Lyman\nalpha systems (DLAs) towards every target, irrespective of its optical\nmagnitude. This approach circumvents selection effects -- particularly from\nintervening dust -- which have long been suspected to affect DLA surveys in\noptically-selected, magnitude-limited QSO samples. The CORALS data set consists\nof 66 z_em > 2.2 QSOs in which 22 DLAs with absorption redshifts 1.8 < z_abs <\nz_em have been identified over a total redshift interval Delta z = 55.46. In\nthis first paper of the CORALS series we describe the sample, present\nintermediate resolution spectroscopy and determine the population statistics of\nDLAs. We deduce a value of the neutral gas mass density traced by DLAs\n(expressed as a fraction of the closure density) log Omega_DLA h =\n-2.59^{+0.17}_{-0.24}, and a number density of DLAs per unit redshift n(z) =\n0.31^{+0.09}_{-0.08}, both at a mean redshift <z> = 2.37. Taking into account\nthe errors, we conclude that dust-induced bias in previous surveys may have led\nto an underestimate of these quantities by at most a factor of two and we have\nnot uncovered a previously unrecognised population of high column density DLAs\nin front of faint QSOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2001 14:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Relevant\nclassical communication concepts are reviewed. Communication and measurement\nprocesses are compared. The possible advantages of nonclassical states in\nclassical information transfer are assessed. The significance of novel quantum\namplifiers and duplicators in communication is emphasized. A general approach\nis developed for determining the ultimate accuracy limit in quantum measurement\nsystems. It is found that bandwidth or mode number is a most important\nparameter and ultrahigh precision measurement is possible in systems with a\nfixed energy but many modes. The problem of the standard quantum limit in\nmonitoring the position of a free mass is also addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2001 01:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Yuen","title":"How unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment is possible","comments":"36 pages; made a few clarifications and elaborations in this revision","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  Bit commitment involves the submission of evidence from one party to another\nso that the evidence can be used to confirm a later revealed bit value by the\nfirst party, while the second party cannot determine the bit value from the\nevidence alone. It is widely believed that unconditionally secure quantum bit\ncommitment is impossible due to quantum entanglement cheating, which is\ncodified in a general impossibility theorem. In this paper, the scope of this\ngeneral impossibility proof is analyzed, and gaps are found. Two variants of a\nbit commitment scheme utilizing anonymous quantum states and decoy states are\npresented. In the first variant, the exact verifying measurement is independent\nof the committed bit value, thus the second party can make it before the first\nparty opens, making possible an unconditional security proof based on\nno-cloning. In the second variant, the impossibility proof fails because\nquantum entanglement purification of a mixed state does not render the protocol\ndeterminate. Whether impossibility holds in this or similar protocols is an\nopen question, although preliminary results already show that the impossibility\nproof cannot work as it stands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2001 01:39:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2001 20:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These invariants\nare naturally arised from the physical consideration of checking multipartite\nmixed states by measuring them with multipartite separable pure states. The\nalgebraic sets have to be the sum of linear subspaces if the multipartite mixed\nstate is separable, and thus we give a new separability criterion of\nmultipartite mixed states. A continuous family of 4-party mixed states, whose\nmembers are separable for any 2:2 cut and entangled for any 1:3 cut (thus bound\nentanglement if 4 parties are isolated), is constructed and studied from our\ninvariants and separability criterion. Examples of LOCC-incomparable entangled\ntripartite pure states are given to show it is hopeless to characterize the\nentanglement properties of tripartite pure states by only using the eigenvalue\nspeactra of their partial traces. We also prove that at least $n^2+n-1$ terms\nof separable pure states, which are \"orthogonal\" in some sence, are needed to\nwrite a generic pure state in $H_A^{n^2} \\otimes H_B^{n^2} \\otimes H_C^{n^2}$\nas a linear combination of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2001 03:57:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2001 09:27:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2001 07:53:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2001 05:31:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2002 14:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
