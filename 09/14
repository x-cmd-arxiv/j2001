In the calcium aluminosilicate melt, the number of non-bridging\noxygens found is in excess of the number obtained from a simple stoichiometric\nprediction. In addition, the aluminum avoidance principle, which states that\nlinks between AlO$_4$ tetrahedra are absent or rare, is found to be violated.\nDefects such as 2-fold rings and 5-fold coordinated silicon atoms are found in\ncomparable proportions in both liquids. However, in the calcium aluminosilicate\nmelt, a larger proportion of oxygen atoms are 3-fold coordinated. In addition,\n5-fold coordinated aluminum atoms are observed. Finally evidence of creation\nand anihilation of non-bridging oxygens is observed, with these oxygens being\nmostly connected to Si tetrahedra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2001 13:22:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2001 14:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

A full functional minimization of the associated free energy is\nperformed through solution of a coupled set of Euler-Lagrange equations.\nViolation of particle-hole exchange symmetry emerges as a crucial aspect of the\nlambda transition, along with broken gauge symmetry. In conjunction with a\nsemi-phenomenological study in which renormalized effective masses are\nintroduced for quasiparticle/quasihole excitations, the results suggest that a\nquantitative description can be achieved once the trial density matrix is\nmodified to include backflow effects and allow for ab initio treatment of\nimportant variations in effective masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2001 13:31:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
