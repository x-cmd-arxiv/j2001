For the first time, theoretical models are compared with a {\\it family}\nof measured T dwarf spectra at wavelengths shortward of $\\sim$1.0 micron. By\ndefining spectral indices and standard colors in the optical and very\nnear-infrared, we explore the theoretical systematics with \\teff, gravity, and\nmetallicity. We conclude that the short- wavelength range is rich in\ndiagnostics that complement those in the near-infrared now used for spectral\nsubtyping. We also conclude that the wings of the Na D and K I (7700\\AA)\nresonance lines and aggressive rainout of heavy metals (with the resulting\nenhancement of the sodium and potassium abundances at altitude) are required to\nfit the new data shortward of 1.0 \\mic. Furthermore, we find that the water\nbands weaken with increasing gravity, that modest decreases in metallicity\nenhance the effect in the optical of the sodium and potassium lines, and that\nat low \\teffs, in a reversal of the normal pattern, optical spectra become\nbluer with further decreases in \\teff. Moreover, we conclude that T dwarf\nsubtype is not a function of \\teff alone, but that it is a non-trivial function\nof gravity and metallicity as well. As do Marley et al. (2001), we see evidence\nin early T dwarf atmospheres of a residual effect of clouds. With cloudless\nmodels, we obtain spectral fits to the two late T dwarfs with known parallaxes,\nbut a residual effect of clouds on the emergent spectra of even late T dwarfs\ncan not yet be discounted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2001 18:10:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2002 17:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

There appear two rotational bands comprised mainly of $K^\\pi\n= 0^+$ and $K^\\pi = 2^+$, respectively, at low excitation energy, where the two\nvalence neutrons occupy $K^\\pi = 3/2^-$ or $K^\\pi = 1/2^-$ orbits. The\ntriaxiality and the $K$-mixing are discussed in connection to the molecular\nstructure, particularly, to the spin-orbit splitting. The extent of the\ntriaxial deformation is evaluated in terms of the electro-magnetic transition\nmatrix elements (Davydov-Filippov model, Q-invariant model), and density\ndistribution in the intrinsic frame. The obtained values turned out to be\n$\\gamma = 15^o \\sim 20^o$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2001 13:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

We show how to adapt the simplest case of\nthe well-known phase estimation quantum algorithm to perform both tasks, giving\nit a natural interpretation as a simulated scattering experiment. We show how\nthis algorithm can be used to implement an interesting form of tomography by\nperforming a direct measurement of the Wigner function of a quantum system. We\npresent results of such measurements performed on a system of three qubits\nusing liquid state NMR quantum computation techniques in a sample of\ntrichloroethylene.
