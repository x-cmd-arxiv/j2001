Two cases with $\\gamma$\nof 1.01 and 1.2 are studied. Our calculations show that the gas, flowing from\nthe companion via a Lagrangian L1 point towards the accretion disk, forms a\nfine gas beam (L1 stream), which penetrates into the disk. No hot spot\ntherefore forms in these calculations. Another fact discovered is that the gas\nrotating with the disk forms, on collision with the L1 stream, a bow shock\nwave, which may be called an L1 shock. The disk becomes hot because the L1\nshock heats the disk gas in the outer parts of the disk, so that the spiral\nshocks wind loosely even with $\\gamma=1.01$. The L1 shock enhances the\nnon-axisymmetry of the density distribution in the disk, and therefore the\nangular momentum transfer by the tidal torque works more effectively.

In agreement with theoretical\nexpectations and earlier results we found significant differences between the\nspatial distributions of low (LMXB) and high (HMXB) mass X-ray binaries. The\nvolume density of LMXB sources peaks strongly at the Galactic Bulge. HMXBs tend\nto avoid the inner 3-4 kpc of the Galaxy, HMXBs are more concentrated towards\nthe Galactic Plane and show clear signatures of the spiral structure in their\nspatial distribution. LMXB sources have a flatter Log(N)-Log(S) distribution\nand luminosity function than HMXBs.
