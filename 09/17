In order to overcome the\nzero-spacing problems, the interferometric data were combined with single-dish\nmeasurements obtained with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. The observed\nmagnetic field structure in NGC 3627 suggests that two field components are\nsuperposed.

In the western disk the latter component is well aligned with an\noptical dust lane, following a bend which is possibly caused by external\ninteractions. However, in the SE disk the magnetic field crosses a heavy dust\nlane segment, apparently being insensitive to strong density-wave effects.
