The root of the domain\nname system is the top of the hierarchy and is currently managed by a\nquasi-private centralized regulatory authority, the Internet Corporation for\nAssigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This paper identifies and discusses the\neconomic and policy issues raised by competing DNS roots. The paper provides a\nprecise definition of root-competition and shows that multiple roots are a\nspecies of standards competition, in which network externalities play a major\nrole. The paper performs a structural analysis of the different forms that\ncompeting DNS roots can take and their effects on end-user compatibility. It\nthen explores the policy implications of the various forms of competition.\n  The thesis of the paper is that root competition is caused by a severe\ndisjunction between the demand for and supply of top-level domain names. ICANN\nhas authorized a tiny number of new top-level domains (7) and subjected their\noperators to excruciatingly slow and expensive contractual negotiations. The\ngrowth of alternate DNS roots is an attempt to bypass that bottleneck. The\npaper arrives at the policy conclusion that competition among DNS roots should\nbe permitted and is a healthy outlet for inefficiency or abuses of power by the\ndominant root administrator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2001 22:01:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2001 23:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

They encapsulate a\nset of binary constraints and using global reasoning about this set they filter\nthe domains of involved variables better than arc consistency among the set of\nbinary constraints. Moreover, global constraints exploit semantic information\nto achieve more efficient filtering than generalised consistency algorithms for\nn-ary constraints. Continued expansion of constraint programming (CP) to\nvarious application areas brings new challenges for design of global\nconstraints. In particular, application of CP to advanced planning and\nscheduling (APS) requires dynamic additions of new variables and constraints\nduring the process of constraint satisfaction and, thus, it would be helpful if\nthe global constraints could adopt new variables. In the paper, we give a\nmotivation for such dynamic global constraints and we describe a dynamic\nversion of the well-known alldifferent constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2001 05:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It aims to illustrate\nexplain and explore the implications of the movement of regulatory sovereignty\naway from the nation-state, through regional conduits, to global organisations\nin the crystallisation of a world system of telecommunications governance.\n  Our central argument is that telecommunications governance has evolved from a\nregulatory arena characterised, in large part, by national diversity, to one\nwherein a more convergent global multilayered system is emerging. We suggest\nthat the epicentre of this regulatory system is the relatively new World Trade\nOrganisation (WTO). Working in concert with the WTO are existing\nwell-established nodes regulation. In further complement, we see regional\nregulatory projects, notably the European Union (EU), as important conduits and\nnodes of regulation in the consolidation of a global regulatory regime.\n  By way of procedure, we first explore the utility of a neo-Gramscian approach\nfor understanding the development of global regulatory frameworks. Second, we\nsurvey something of the recent history - and, in extension, conventional wisdom\n- of telecommunications regulation at national and regional levels. Third, we\ndemonstrate how a multilayered system of global telecommunications regulation\nhas emerged centred around the regulatory authority of the WTO.

So, in the chiral symmetry limit when the masses of the lightest ($u$\nand $d$) quarks vanish, all the quark mixing angles vanish. This minimal\npattern is shown to fit extremely well the already established CKM matrix\nelements and to give fairly distinctive predictions for the as yet poorly known\nones. Remarkably, together with generically small quark mixing, it also leads\nto large neutrino mixing, provided that neutrino masses appear through the\nordinary ``see-saw'' mechanism. It is natural to think that this minimal\nflavour mixing pattern presupposes some underlying family symmetry, treating\nfamilies of quarks and leptons in a special way. Indeed, we have found a local\nchiral $SU(3)_{F}$ family symmetry model which leads, through its dominant\nsymmetry breaking vacuum configuration, to a natural realization of the\nproposed minimal mechanism. It can also naturally generate the quark and lepton\nmass hierarchies.
