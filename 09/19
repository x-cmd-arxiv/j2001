Most studies on the development of the instability\nso far have been based on an initial equilibrium system with a uniform magnetic\nfield. However, the Galactic magnetic field possesses a random component in\naddition to the mean uniform component, with comparable strength of the two\ncomponents. Parker and Jokipii have recently suggested that the random\ncomponent can suppress the growth of small wavelength perturbations. Here, we\nextend their analysis by including gas pressure which was ignored in their\nwork, and study the stabilizing effect of the random component in the\ninterstellar gas with finite pressure. Following Parker and Jokipii, the\nmagnetic field is modeled as a mean azimuthal component, $B(z)$, plus a random\nradial component, $\\epsilon(z) B(z)$, where $\\epsilon(z)$ is a random function\nof height from the equatorial plane. We show that for the observationally\nsuggested values of $<\\epsilon^2>^{1/2}$, the tension due to the random\ncomponent becomes important, so that the growth of the instability is either\nsignificantly reduced or completely suppressed.

We have constructed numerical solutions\nof approximate 3-dimensional irradiated equipotential surfaces to demonstrate\nthe main geometrical effects of external radiation pressure. For systems in\nwhich the inner Lagrangian point is irradiated directly and for sufficiently\nhigh irradiation fluxes, the critical condition for which the secondary fills\nits tidal lobe changes from an inner to an outer critical configuration, where\nthe critical equipotential surface connects to one of the outer rather than the\ninner Lagrangian point.

When reconnecting, the system has to\nreconcile the divergent replicas. In the log-based approach to reconciliation,\nsuch as in the IceCube system, the input is a common initial state and logs of\nactions that were performed on each replica. The output is a consistent global\nschedule that maximises the number of accepted actions. The reconciler merges\nthe logs according to the schedule, and replays the operations in the merged\nlog against the initial state, yielding to a reconciled common final state.\n  In this paper, we show the NP-completeness of the log-based reconciliation\nproblem and present two programs for solving it. Firstly, a constraint logic\nprogram (CLP) that uses integer constraints for expressing precedence\nconstraints, boolean constraints for expressing dependencies between actions,\nand some heuristics for guiding the search. Secondly, a stochastic local search\nmethod with Tabu heuristic (LS), that computes solutions in an incremental\nfashion but does not prove optimality. One difficulty in the LS modeling lies\nin the handling of both boolean variables and integer variables, and in the\nhandling of the objective function which differs from a max-CSP problem.\nPreliminary evaluation results indicate better performance for the CLP program\nwhich, on somewhat realistic benchmarks, finds nearly optimal solutions up to a\nthousands of actions and proves optimality up to a hundreds of actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2001 19:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The theoretical treatment uses a\nLaplace transform approach to solve the time-dependent density matrix equation.\nThe experiments are carried out in a Rb$^{87}$ MOT. The results show transient\nprobe gain in parameter regions not previously studied, and provide insight\ninto the transition dynamics between bare and dressed states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2001 13:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
