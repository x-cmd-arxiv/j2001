The objects were discovered in a high proper\nmotion survey in the poorly investigated southern sky region with\n$\\delta<-60^{\\circ}$ using SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey (SSS) data. Both objects,\nSSSPM J2231-7514 and SSSPM J2231-7515, show featureless optical spectra. Fits\nof black-body models to the spectra yield effective temperatures of 3810 K and\n3600 K, respectively for the bright (V=16.60) and faint (V=16.87) component.\nBoth degenerates are much brighter than other recent discoveries of cool white\ndwarfs with comparable effective temperatures and/or $B_J-R$ colours.\nTherefore, they should be relatively nearby objects. The comparison with other\ncool white dwarfs and a photometric distance determination yield distance\nestimates between 9 pc and 14 pc. The latter seems to be more realistic, since\nthe good agreement of the proper motion of both components within the errors of\nabout 8 mas/yr and the angular separation between the two stars support a\ndistance of about 15 pc with relatively small masses of the components. With\nsmaller distance we should be able to measure a differential proper motion due\nto orbital motion if the orbital plane is not strongly inclined and the present\norbital velocity vector is not close to the line of sight. The space velocity\nbased on that distance and assumptions on radial velocity makes the new pair of\nextremely cool white dwarfs some of the probably oldest members of the Galactic\ndisk population, although the possibility that these objects are part of a\nGalactic halo dark matter component can also not yet be ruled out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2001 15:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

A backward spin-polarizability of\ngamma(pi)=(-37.1+-0.6(stat+syst)+-3.0(model))x10^{-4}fm^4 has been determined\nfrom data of the first resonance region below 455 MeV. This value is in a good\nagreement with predictions of dispersion relations and chiral pertubation\ntheory. From a subset of data between 280 and 360 MeV the resonance\npion-photoproduction amplitudes were evaluated leading to a E2/M1 multipole\nratio of the p-to-Delta radiative transition of EMR(340\nMeV)=(-1.7+-0.4(stat+syst)+-0.2(model))%. It was found that this number is\ndependent on the parameterization of photo-meson amplitudes. With the MAID2K\nparameterization an E2/M1 multipole ratio of EMR(340\nMeV)=(-2.0+-0.4(stat+syst)+-0.2(model))% is obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2001 16:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-26"}
