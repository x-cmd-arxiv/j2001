Salaris and the most recent set from the Padova\ngroup, and new semi-empirical calibrations between fundamental stellar\nparameters and observables. We highlight the importance of correctly modeling\nthe luminosity function (LF) of the cluster at the level of the giant branch,\nin order to achieve a good reproduction of the integrated spectrum; agreement\nbetween the spectroscopic age and the age based on the cluster's\ncolor-magnitude diagram (CMD) is achieved only if the observed LF is used\nrather than the theoretical ones, which either do not include AGB stars\n(Salaris) or underpredict the total number counts of bright giants in the\ncluster by a factor of two(Padova). After all corrections are made, the CMD and\nthe spectroscopic ages (from Hgamma and Hbeta) are in close agreement: 11--12\nGyrs for Salaris isochrones and about 13 Gyrs for Padova. The difference\nbetween the model ages is due to the inclusion of atomic diffusion in the\nSalaris models. Previously older spectroscopic ages were due to the\nunderestimate of the number of red giants and/or the use of isochrones that\nneglected the effects of He-diffusion and alpha-enhancement. A similar\nunderestimate in the bright giant LF, if it exists in current super-solar\nmetallicity models, would cause spectroscopic ages of elliptical galaxies\ninferred from such models to be too high by approximately 30%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2001 22:25:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2002 21:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The CFH12K photometry for this cluster is faint enough (V ~ 24.5) to\ndetect the remnants of the most massive progenitor cluster stars under the Type\nI SNe limit. Therefore, the CMD of the cluster also exhibits a well defined\nwhite dwarf `clump' caused by the decreased rate of cooling of these stars as\nthey age, and a subsequent gap with very few objects. The termination point (Mv\n= 11.95 +/- 0.30) of the white dwarf luminosity function gives a white dwarf\ncooling age of 566 +/- 154/176 Myrs which is in excellent agreement with the\nmain-sequence turn-off isochrone age (520 Myrs).

Based on the\nmean field calculations for the three band model of spinless fermions\nappropriate for the d electrons of the Fe ions on the B sites, it is indicated\nthat the phase transition should be the bond dimerization due to the\ncooperative effects of strong electronic correlation and electron-phonon\ninteraction. The results show that the ferro-orbital ordered state is\nstabilized in a wide temperature range due to the strong on-site Coulomb\ninteraction between different t2g orbitals resulting in an effectively\none-dimensional electronic state, which leads the system toward an insulating\nstate by the Peierls lattice distortion with the period of two Fe(B) ions,\ni.e., bond dimerization. Furthermore, it is found that the interplay between\nsuch lattice distortion in the Fe(B) ions and the lattice elastic energy of the\nFe(B)-O as well as the Fe(A)-O bonds gives rise to a competition between two\ndifferent three-dimensional patterns for the bond dimerization, and can\nstabilize a complicated one with a large unit cell size. The results are\ncompared with the known experimental facts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2001 06:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the limit where\nthe number N of agents is infinite, the dynamics of the fraction of bullish\nagents is deterministic and exhibits chaotic behavior in a significant domain\nof the parameter space of the model. A typical chaotic trajectory is\ncharacterized by intermittent phases of chaos, quasi-periodic behavior and\nsuper-exponentially growing bubbles followed by crashes. A typical bubble\nstarts initially by growing at an exponential rate and then crosses over to a\nnonlinear power law growth rate leading to a finite-time singularity. The\nreinjection mechanism provided by the contrarian behavior introduces a\nfinite-size effect, rounding off these singularities and leads to chaos. We\ndocument the main stylized facts of this model in the symmetric and asymmetric\ncases.

We define a\nsimple promise problem which minimal quantum oracles can solve exponentially\nfaster than classical oracles, via an algorithm which cannot be naively adapted\nto standard quantum oracles. We show that $S_f$ can be constructed by invoking\n$M_f$ and $(M_f)^{-1}$ once each, while $\\Theta(\\sqrt{N})$ invocations of $S_f$\nand/or $(S_f)^{-1}$ are required to construct $M_f$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2001 18:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2002 15:43:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2002 18:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Second, we calculate the entanglement through the\nalgorithm for any number of qubits $n$ as the minimum Fubini-Study distance to\nthe submanifold formed by separable states in Segre embedding, and find that\nentanglement is used almost maximally for large $n$.
