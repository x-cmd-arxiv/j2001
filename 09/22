An iron emission line attributed to\nthe quasar at ~6.43 keV (rest frame) is clearly resolved, with an equivalent\nwidth of ~100 eV. Although we cannot rule out contributions to the line from a\nputative torus, the diskline model provides an acceptable fit to this iron\nline. We also detect a weak emission feature at ~6.9 keV (rest frame). We\nsuggest that both lines could originate in an accretion disk comprised of a\nhighly ionized optically thin atmosphere sitting atop a mostly neutral disk. We\nsearch for absorption features from a warm/hot component of the intergalactic\nmedium along the ~1.5Gpc/h line of sight to the quasar. No absorption features\nare detected at or above the 3 sigma level while a total of six OVI intervening\nabsorption systems have been detected with HST and FUSE. Based on the lack of\nOVII and OVIII absorption lines and by assuming collisionally ionization, we\nconstrain the gas temperature of a typical OVI absorber to 10^5 < T < 10^6 K,\nwhich is consistent with the results from hydrodynamic simulations of the\nintergalactic medium.

We have been able to separate the moderate CCD X-ray\nspectrum of the surrounding cluster from the central quasar and find that this\nis a hot cluster with a temperature of ~10 keV and a metal abundance of ~0.3\nZo.

As a measure of central density, we adopt the quantity D_{V/2},\nthe density within the radius R_{V/2} at which the halo rotation curve falls to\nhalf of its maximum value, in units of the critical density. We compare the\ntheoretical predictions to values of D_{V/2} estimated from the rotation curves\nof dark matter dominated disk galaxies.

Soon there was great diversity in the overall\nregulatory landscape. Within this new environment, there is considerable\ndisparity among the PUCs in terms of their ability to implement new ideas. This\npaper seeks to understand the structural factors that influence the latitude of\nregulatory action by PUCs via a comparative study of local telephone\ncompetition policy making in Arkansas and New York. The analysis suggests that\nthe presence or absence of countervailing forces determines the relative\nautonomy the PUCs enjoy and thereby their ability to introduce new ideas into\ntheir states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2001 17:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\nfind that Muller's ratchet can come to a halt in small populations as a\nconsequence of a finite genome size only, in the complete absence of backward\nor compensatory mutations, epistasis, or recombination. The origin of this\neffect lies in the fact that the number of loci at which mutations can create\nconsiderable damage decreases with every turn of the ratchet, while the total\nnumber of mutations per genome and generation remains constant. Whether the\nratchet will come to a halt eventually depends on the ratio of the per-locus\ndeleterious mutation rate $u$ and the selection strength $s$. For sufficiently\nsmall $u/s$, the ratchet halts after only a few clicks. We discuss the\nimplications of our results for bacterial and virus evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2001 23:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
