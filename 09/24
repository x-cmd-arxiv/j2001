This work represents an extension of our\nprevious studies (Treyer et al. 1998; Sullivan et al. 2000, 2001) on\nUV-selected galaxies. We revisit the optical spectra of these galaxies and\nperform further emission-line measurements restricting the analysis to those\nspectra with the full set of emission lines required to derive chemical\nabundances. Our final sample consists of 68 galaxies with heavy element\nabundance ratios and both UV and CCD B-band photometry. Diagnostics based on\nemission-line ratios show that all but one of the galaxies in our sample are\npowered by hot, young stars rather than by an AGN. Oxygen-to-hydrogen (O/H) and\nnitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratios are compared to those for various\nlocal and intermediate-redshift samples. Our UV-selected galaxies span a wide\nrange of oxygen abundances, from 0.1 Zsun to solar, intermediate between\nlow-mass HII galaxies and massive starburst nuclei. For a given oxygen\nabundance, most have strikingly low N/O values. Moreover, UV-selected and HII\ngalaxies systematically deviate from the usual metallicity-luminosity relation\nin the sense of being more luminous by 2-3 magnitudes. Adopting the\n\"delayed-release\" chemical evolution model, we propose our UV-selected sources\nare observed at a special stage in their evolution, following a powerful\nstarburst which enriched their ISM in oxygen and temporarily lowered their\nmass-to-light ratios. We discuss briefly the implications of our conclusions on\nthe nature of similarly-selected high-redshift galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2001 12:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Theoretically, the answer\ncould be either \"yes\" or \"no,\" due to two opposing incentives in firms' pricing\ndecisions. The firm would like to charge a higher price to previous purchasers\nwho are \"locked-in\" and a lower price to unattached consumers who offer higher\nfuture profitability. I demonstrate this ambiguity in an infinite-horizon\ntheoretical model.\n  800- (toll-free) number portability provides empirical evidence to answer\nthis question. Before portability, a customer had to change numbers to change\nservice providers. This imposed significant switching costs on users, who\ngenerally invested heavily to publicize these numbers. In May 1993 a new\ndatabase made 800-numbers portable. This drop in switching costs and\nregulations that precluded price discrimination between old and new consumers\nprovide an empirical test of switching costs' effect on price competition.\n  I use contracts for virtual private network (VPN) services to test how AT&T\nadjusted its prices for toll-free services in response to portability.\nPreliminarily (awaiting completion of data collection), I find that AT&T\nreduced margins for VPN contracts containing toll-free services relative to\nthose that did not as the portability date approached. This implies that the\nswitching costs due to non-portability made the market less competitive.

In the case of the R.E.A., the necessity for an\naggressive federal initiative to wire rural America, where the market for\nelectricity had failed, is revisited as the missing incentives are identified\nand explored. We then examine the incentive-poor similarities between rural\nelectrification and rural high-speed Internet access through how consumers\ncurrently and prospectively gain access to broadband Internet service. The\nregulatory environment created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the\nFederal Communications Commission is considered. Although the FCC is required\n(Section 254.b.3) to take regulatory measures to ensure comparable and\naffordable access to the Internet for all Americans, the historical\nsimilarities and comparative analysis of rural electrification and high-speed\nInternet access suggests the goal of universal service is unlikely to be met in\nthe near future. Regulatory disincentives to build such networks are present,\ndriven in part by market realities and in part by competitive restrictions in\nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996. Finally, we pose the question of whether a\nfederal effort equivalent to the R.E.A. is needed to ensure that residents of\nsparsely populated areas, like their predecessors in the 1930s, are not\ncomparatively disadvantaged in the first decades of the 21st century.

This paper presents the operating cost portion of\nour ongoing research project comparing circuit-switched and IP network costs\nfor an existing local exchange carrier.\n  We have found that (1) The operating cost differential between IP and circuit\nswitching for this LEC will be small; and (2) A substantial majority of a\ntelco's operating cost lies in customer service and outside plant maintenance,\nwhich will be incurred equally in both networks in a pure substitution\nscenario. Thus, the operating cost difference lies in the actual cost\ndifferences of the switching technologies. This appears to be less than 10%-15%\nof the total operating cost of the network. Thus, even if the cost differences\nfor substitute services were large, the overall impact on the telco's financial\nperformance would be small.
