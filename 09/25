We include in all equations the\nflow velocity terms and neglect the partial derivatives with respect to time.\nWe present a complete and physically consistent formulation and method for\nsolving the non-LTE and energy balance equations in these situations, including\nboth particle diffusion and flows of H and He. Our results show quantitatively\nhow mass flows affect the ionization and radiative losses of H and He, thereby\naffecting the structure and extent of the transition region. Also, our\ncomputations show that the H and He line profiles are greatly affected by\nflows. We find that line shifts are much less important than the changes in\nline intensity and central reversal due to the effects of flows. In this paper\nwe use fixed conditions at the base of the transition region and in the\nchromosphere because our intent is to show the physical effects of flows and\nnot to match any particular observations. However, we note that the profiles we\ncompute can explain the range of observed high spectral and spatial resolution\nLyman alpha profiles from the quiet Sun. We suggest that dedicated modeling of\nspecific sequences of observations based on physically consistent methods like\nthose presented here will substantially improve our understanding of the energy\nbalance in the chromosphere and corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2001 19:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The dependence of our results on\nthe length of the simulation run indicates that individual particles have a\ncharacteristic mobility time scale, which can be approximated via the\nnon-Gaussian parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2001 14:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In this article we focus on a hitherto-neglected implication of\nICANN's assertion that it is a private rather than a public actor: its\npotential liability under the U.S. antitrust laws, and the liability of those\nwho transact with it. ICANN argues that it is not as closely tied to the\ngovernment as NSI and IANA were in the days before ICANN was created. If this\nis correct, it seems likely that ICANN will not benefit from the antitrust\nimmunity those actors enjoyed. Some of ICANN's regulatory actions may restrain\ncompetition, e.g. its requirement that applicants for new gTLDs demonstrate\nthat their proposals would not enable competitive (alternate) roots and ICANN's\npreventing certain types of non-price competition among registrars (requiring\nthe UDRP).

Yet technology is hardly an exogenous factor\nthat independently shapes future local access competition; the regulatory\nenvironment also plays a key role.

The evidence in these four\nsites is consistent with earlier findings in Blacksburg, Virginia (Kavanaugh,\n2000; Patterson and Kavanaugh, 2001; Kavanaugh and Patterson, 2001) and other\nstudies of early innovation adopters (Rogers, 1983; Kohut, 1999; Valente, 1995,\namong others). The results reported in this paper lend weight to the argument\nthat increases in civic engagement and community involvement are due primarily\nto the behavior of early adopters, making such increases a phase, not a trend.\nAs later adopters come on line, use of the Internet for community involvement\nor civic engagement decreases. In the long term, we can expect that Internet\naccess may have only a modest effect on community involvement and civic\nengagement in geographic communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2001 21:52:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2001 03:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The descriptive data analysis of the seller's equilibrium\nlisting behavior indicates that a seller's higher expected auction revenue from\neBay is correlated with a lager number of potential bidders measured by website\nusage per listing. Our estimation results, based on the logarithm\nspecifications of sellers' expected auction revenues and potential bidders'\nwebsite usage, show that in a median case, (i) 1 percent increase of the unique\nvisitors (page views) per listed item induces 0.022 (0.007) percent increase of\na seller's expected auction revenue; and (ii) 1 percent increase of sellers'\nlistings induces 1.99 (4.74) percent increase of the unique visitors (page\nviews).

Consequently, Yahoo!Auctions, which has substantially less listings, has\ngreater incentives to increase listings via these feedback effects which are\nreflected in its fee schedules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2001 21:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

No. But for\nmany computer applications,a software developer will need to reveal a great\ndeal about the code to get other system owners to trust the code and know how\nto operate with it.\n  This article examines these conflicting intuitions and develops a theory\nabout what should be open and hidden in computer security. Part I of the paper\nshows how substantial openness is typical for major computer security topics,\nsuch as firewalls, packaged software, and encryption. Part II shows what\nfactors will lead to openness or hiddenness in computer security.\n  Part III presents an economic analysis of the issue of what should be open in\ncomputer security. The owner who does not reveal the booby traps is like a\nmonopolist, while the open-source software supplier is in a competitive market.\nThis economic approach allows us to identify possible market failures in how\nmuch openness occurs for computer security.\n  Part IV examines the contrasting approaches of Sun Tzu and Clausewitz to the\nrole of hiddenness and deception in military strategy. The computer security,\neconomic, and military strategy approaches thus each show factors relevant to\nwhat should be kept hidden in computer security.

Yochai Benkler has argued\nthat a decentralized, peer-to-peer system of communications and information is\nboth possible with digital technology and preferable to a system based on\ncommercial mass media. He has contended in fact that the presence of\npolitically powerful, copyright-rich mass media imposes significant barriers to\nthe development of peer-to-peer information-sharing networks. In contrast, I\nhave argued that the commercial mass media play an important, and perhaps even\nvital, role in liberal democracy by galvanizing public opinion, serving as a\nwatchdog against government and corporate wrongdoing, agenda-setting (which\nenables public discourse), and serving as a relatively trustworthy source of\ninformation. This paper seeks to push the ball forward on this issue. It first\nisolates and enumerates the contributions that the commercial mass media are\nsaid to make towards liberal democracy. It then briefly assesses the extent to\nwhich the commercial mass media actually fulfills these constitutive functions.\nIt then asks whether alternative institutions might serve some or all of these\nfunctions just as well or better.

This policy was modeled in many respects on the access and unbundling\nrequirements applicable to domestic incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs)\nunder the Telecommunications Act of 1996. At the same time, incumbent domestic\ncable TV system operators have not been required to provide wholesale open\naccess to competitive Internet Service Providers (ISPs) seeking to provide\nresidential broadband Internet service through existing proprietary cable\nfacilities. Yet the policy arguments favoring open access to incumbent domestic\ncable systems appear to be stronger than those favoring direct access to\nINTELSAT.\n  For example, it may be fairly debated whether entrenched cable system\noperators are now positioned to unfairly leverage their dominance in the\nmultichannel video programming distribution (MVPD) market to thwart competition\nin the broadband ISP market, as some cable open access advocates assert. In\ncontrast, it is clear that no analogous issues of tying were implicated by\nINTELSAT in 1999, when its position in the international telecommunications\nmarket was substantially nondominant and, in any event, it had no new product\nto tie to its established offerings.

A feminist critique suggests that the social utility of privacy is to\nexclude certain issues from the public realm. Sociologists suggest that privacy\nis about identity management, while political economists suggest that the most\nsalient privacy issue is the use of personal information to normalize and\nrationalize populations according to the needs of capital.\n  While PETs have been developed for use by individual consumers, recently\ndevelopers are focusing on the business to business market, where demand is\nstoked by the existence of new privacy regulations.

We discuss three potential transmission channels by which license fees\ncan influence the price and quantity of service sold in a wireless market: an\nincrease in average cost, an increase in incremental costs, and impacts of sunk\ncosts on the emerging market structure.\n  From this conceptual debate, an empirical model is developed and tested using\ncross-sectional data for the residential mobile voice market. We utilize a\nstructural equation approach, modeling the supply and demand relationships\nsubject to the constraint that supply equals demand. The results confirm the\nexistence of a positive effect of license fees on the cost of supply.

In this situation the main nonlinear mechanism is the resonance\nscattering of fast magneto-acoustic and Alfvenic waves on slow magneto-acoustic\nwaves. As a result, the former waves serve as the high-frequency waves with\nrespect to the latter ones so that the total number of HF waves - an adiabatic\ninvariant - conserves additionally. In the weak turbulence regime this\ninvariant is shown to generate the Kolmogorov type spectrum with a constant\nflux of HF waves towards large-scale region. In the short-wave region another\nKolmogorov spectrum can be realized with a constant energy flux. The explicit\nangle dependences for both types of turbulent spectra are found for the\npropagation angles close to the direction of a mean magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2001 13:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

For a\nsuitable choice of parameters, this system gives rise to a very narrow\nstructure at the laser frequency in the fluorescence spectrum which is not\npresent in the spectrum of a two-level atom. We find those parameter ranges by\na numerical analysis and use the results to derive analytical expressions for\nthe additional narrow peak. We also derive an exact expression for the peak\nintensity under the assumption that a random telegraph model is applicable to\nthe system. This model and a simple spring model are then used to describe the\nphysical origins of the additional peak.
