From earlier surface photometry we adopt a value for the radial\nscalelength of the disk of 7 +/- 1 kpc, a vertical scaleheight of 0.65 +/- 0.05\nkpc and a disk truncation radius of 17 +/- 1 kpc. The very thin appearance of\nIC 5249 on the sky is the result of a combination of a low (face-on) surface\nbrightness, a long scalelength and a a sharp truncation at only about 2.5\nscalelengths. From various arguments we derive the stellar velocity dispersions\nat a position one radial scalelength as sigma_R about 35 km/s, sigma_{theta}\nabout 30 km/s and sigma_z about 20 km/s. This is comparable to the values for\nthe disk of our Galaxy in the solar neighborhood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2001 13:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The presence of interstellar dust\nand ultraviolet photons are two necessary conditions for ERE to occur.

In this study, we have collected all published\nERE observations with absolute-calibrated spectra for interstellar\nenvironments, where the density of ultraviolet photons can be estimated\nreliably. In each case, we determined the band-integrated ERE intensity, the\nwavelength of peak emission in the ERE band, and the efficiency with which\nabsorbed ultraviolet photons are contributing to the ERE. The data show that\nradiation is not only driving the ERE, as expected for a photoluminescence\nprocess, but is modifying the ERE carrier as manifested by a systematic\nincrease in the ERE band's peak wavelength and a general decrease in the photon\nconversion efficiency with increasing densities of the prevailing exciting\nradiation.

We show\nthat the sequential tunneling current exhibits a spin satellite peak whose\nlinewidth gives a lower bound on the decoherence time T_2 of the dot-spin.\nSimilarly, the spin decoherence can be accessed also in the cotunneling regime\nvia ESR induced spin flips. We show that the conductance ratio of the spin\nsatellite peak and the conventional peak due to sequential tunneling saturates\nat the universal conductance ratio of 0.71 for strong ESR fields. We describe a\ndouble-dot setup which generates spin dependent tunneling and acts as a current\npump (at zero bias), and as a spin inverter which inverts the spin-polarization\nof the current. We show that Rabi oscillations of the dot-spin induce coherent\noscillations in the time-dependent current. These oscillations are observable\nin the time-averaged current as function of ESR pulse-duration, and they allow\none to access the spin coherence directly in the time domain. We analyze the\nmeasurement and read-out process of the dot-spin via currents in spin-polarized\nleads and identify measurement time and efficiency by calculating the counting\nstatistics, noise, and the Fano factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2001 23:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This contrasts with various complaints that retail\nprices of roaming calls are rigid and excessive. The focus if the paper is on\nwholesale roaming, which is the prime determinant of retail roaming prices. The\npaper analyses the structural conditions of wholesale roaming markets that have\nimpaired incentives to competition, namely high combined market share of the\ntwo leading GSM 900 operators combined with second mover disadvantages for new\nentrant GSM 1800 operators, and demand externalities. The paper argues that a\nnumber of developments are under way that are likely to modify this situation\nin the future. With the introduction of SIM over-the-air programming, home\nmobile operators will be able to direct customers to networks with the lowest\ncharges. As dual mode handsets become ubiquitous and as new entrant GSM 1800\noperators reach nationwide coverage, second-mover disadvantages will disappear.\nGiven the relatively small roaming volumes that GSM 1800 operators currently\nprovide, they should have an incentive to lower charges in exchange for\npreferred roaming status. On the demand side of wholesale roaming markets, it\nwill be the larger GSM 900 operators, and in particular those with a\npan-European footprint, that will ask for lower charges in exchange for\npreferred roaming status. This could discriminate against mobile operators in\ndownstream retail markets that do not have a pan-European footprint and that\nlack the bargaining power.
