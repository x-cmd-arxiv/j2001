We show\nthe basic difference between the formation of low and high mass stars based on\nthe values of the free fall time and of the Kelvin-Helmoltz timescale, and\ndefine the concept of birthline for massive stars.\n  Due to D-burning, the radius and location of the birthline in the HR diagram,\nas well as the lifetimes are very sensitive to the accretion rate \\dot M_accr.\nIf a form \\dot M_accr=A (M/M_sun)^phi is adopted, the observations in the HR\ndiagram and the lifetimes support a value of A=10^{-5} M_sun/yr and a value of\nphi>1. Remarkably, such a law is consistent with the relation found by\nChurchwell (1998) and Henning et al. (2000) between the outflow rates and the\nluminosities of ultra--compact HII regions, if we assume that a fraction 0.15\nto 0.3 of the global inflow is accreted. The above relation implies high \\dot\nM_accr=10^{-3} M_sun/yr for the most massive stars. The physical possibility of\nsuch high \\dot M_accr is supported by current numerical models.\n  Finally, we give simple analytical arguments in favour of the growth of \\dot\nM_accr with the already accreted mass. We also suggest that due to Bondi-Hoyle\naccretion, the formation of binary stars is largely favoured among massive\nstars in the accretion scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2001 08:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nfuzzy band expression is derived in detail from first principles. We go beyond\nthe sudden approximation to account for both extrinsic losses and interference\neffects. In an extension of earlier work we discuss both core and valence\nsatellites including both intrinsic and extrinsic amplitudes, and high energy\nexcitations as well as low energy electron-hole pairs. We show how the\nextrinsic losses in photoemission can be connected with the electron energy\nloss function. This is achieved by three approximations, to connect the\ndynamically screened potential in the bulk solid to the loss function, to\naccount for the surface, and lastly to extrapolate zero momentum loss data to\ninclude dispersion. The extrinsic losses are found to be weak for small loss\nenergies. For larger loss energies the extrinsic losses can be strong and have\nstrong interference with the intrinsic losses depending on the nature of the\nsolid. The transition from the adiabatic to the sudden regime is discussed for\natoms and localized systems and compared with the situation for solids. We\nargue that in solids for photoelectron energies above some 10 eV the external\nlosses are mainly connected with spacially extended excitations. We discuss\nstrongly correlated quasi-two-dimensional solids with Bi2212 as example, and\nfind an asymmetric broadening of the main peak from shake up of acoustic\nthree-dimensional plasmons.

Because of the\nstrong spin-orbit scattering rate in silver this experiment is a test of\nexisting theories on orbital magnetism. Below 100 mK the rings exhibit a\nmagnetic signal with a flux periodicity of h/2 e consistent with averaged\npersistent currents, whose amplitude is estimated to be of the order of 0.3 nA.\nThe sign of the oscillations indicates diamagnetism in the vicinity of zero\nmagnetic field. This sign is not consistent with theoretical predictions for\naverage persistent currents unless considering attractive interactions in\nsilver. We propose an alternative interpretation taking into account spin orbit\nscattering and finite frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2001 13:45:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2002 14:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

A detailed analysis of the microscopic picture of the front dynamics\nshows that for the description of the far tip of the front, one has to abandon\nthe idea of a uniformly translating front solution. The lattice and finite\nparticle effects lead to a ``stop-and-go'' type dynamics at the far tip of the\nfront, while the average front behind it ``crosses over'' to a uniformly\ntranslating solution. In this formulation, the effect of stochasticity on the\nasymptotic front speed is coded in the probability distribution of the times\nrequired for the advancement of the ``foremost bin''. We derive expressions of\nthese probability distributions by matching the solution of the far tip with\nthe uniformly translating solution behind. This matching includes various\ncorrelation effects in a mean-field type approximation. Our results for the\nprobability distributions compare well to the results of stochastic numerical\nsimulations.

The strong phase coming from final-state rescattering due\nto hard gluon exchange between the final states can induce large rate\nasymmetries for tree-dominated color-suppressed modes\n$(\\pi^0,\\rho^0,\\omega)X_{\\bar s}$. The nonfactorizable hard spectator\ninteractions in the 3-body decay $B\\to Mq_1\\bar q_2$, though phase-space\nsuppressed, are extremely important for the tree-dominated modes\n$(\\pi^0,\\rho^0,\\omega)X_{\\bar s},~\\phi X$, $J X_s,J X$ and the\npenguin-dominated mode $\\omega X_{s\\bar s}$. Our result for ${\\cal B}(B\\to J\nX_s)$ is in agreement with experiment. $B^0_s\\to (\\pi^0,\\rho^0,\\omega)X_{\\bar\ns}$, $\\rho^0X_{s\\bar s}$, $B^0\\to(K^-X,K^{*-}X)$ and $B^-\\to\n(K^0X_s,K^{*0}X_s)$ are the most promising ones in searching for direct CP\nviolation: they have branching ratios of order $10^{-6}-10^{-4}$ and CP rate\nasymmetries of order $(10-40)%$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2001 07:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

But it\nis not possible to calculate power corrections in a model-independent way,\nbecause of non-factorizing long-distance contributions. It has been argued that\nSudakov effects suppress these contributions and render the corresponding\ncorrections perturbatively calculable. In this paper we examine this claim for\nthe related example of semileptonic B -> pi decays and conclude that it is not\njustified. The uncertainties in our knowledge of the mesons' distribution\namplitudes imply that the calculations of the form factors are not sufficiently\nprecise to be useful phenomenologically. Moreover, a significant contribution\ncomes from the non-perturbative region of large impact parameters, and is\ntherefore uncalculable.
