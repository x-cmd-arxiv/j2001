The evolution of BBHs depends on BH mass ratio and host galaxy\ntype.

We analyze the flow pattern in such nested bar systems and\nfind that secondary bars differ fundamentally from their large-scale\ncounterparts. In particular the gas flow across the bar-bar interface in these\nsystems can be more chaotic or more regular in nature, and, contrary to\npredictions, has no difficulty in penetrating the secondary bars. The outer\nparts of both short and long nuclear bars (with respect to their corotation)\nappear to be depopulated of gas, while deep inside them the flow exhibits low\nMach numbers and follows ovally-shaped orbits with little dissipation. We find\nthat gas-dominated and star-dominated nuclear bars avoid the bar-bar interface,\nmaking both types of bars short relative to their corotation. Furthermore, our\nearlier work has shown that dynamically-coupled secondary bars exhibit a\nsimilarly relaxed low-dissipation flow as well. Therefore, no large-scale\nshocks form in the nuclear bars, and consequently, no offset dust lanes are\nexpected there. We find that offset dust lanes cannot be used in the search for\nsecondary (nuclear) bars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2001 00:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

For a closed system, in the absence of\nspin-orbit coupling or of an external magnetic field, electron-electron\ninteractions make it possible to have ground states with spin $S > 1/2$. We\nreview here a theoretical analysis which makes predictions for the probability\nof finding various values of spin $S$ for an irregular particle in the limit\nwhere the number of electron is large but finite. We also present results for\nthe probability distribution of the spacing between successive groundstate\nenergies in such a particle. In a metallic particle with strong spin-orbit\ninteractions, for odd electron number, the groundstate has a Kramers'\ndegeneracy, which is split linearly by a weak applied magnetic field. The\nsplitting may be characterized by an effective $g$-tensor whose principal axes\nand eigenvalues vary from one level to another. Recent calculations have\naddressed the joint probability distribution, including the anisotropy, of the\neigenvalues. The peculiar form of the spin-orbit coupling for a two-dimensional\nelectron system in a GaAs heterostructure or quantum well leads to a strong\nsuppression of spin-orbit effects when the electrons are confined in a small\nquantum dot. Spin-effects can be enhanced, however, in the presence of an\napplied magnetic field parallel to the layer, which may explain recent\nobservations on fluctuations in the conductances through such dots.

Similarly\nfor the input $q{\\bar q}$ kernel the gluon propagator is replaced by the above\n$k^{-4}$ form. With these `linear' simulations, the respective condensates are\nobtained by `looping' up the gluon and quark lines in the standard manner.\nUsing Dimensional regularization (DR), the necessary integrals yield the\ncondensates plus temperature corrections, with a common scale parameter $\\mu$\nfor both.

This program can be divided into various steps, which include the\ncomputation of the exact S-matrix, Form Factors of local operators and\ncorrelation functions, as well as the identification of the operator content of\nthe QFT and the development of various consistency checks. Taking as an input\nthe S-matrix proposal for the HSG-models, we confirm its consistency by\ncarrying out both a Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) and a Form Factor\nanalysis. In contrast to many other 1+1-dimensional integrable models studied\nin the literature, the HSG-models break parity, both at the level of the\nLagrangian and S-matrix, and their spectrum includes unstable particles. These\nfeatures have specific consequences in our analysis which are given a physical\ninterpretation. By exploiting the Form Factor approach, we develop further the\nQFT advocated to the HSG-models. We evaluate correlation functions of various\nlocal operators of the model as well as Zamolodchikov's c-function and\n$\\Delta$-sum rules.

In the first, it arises as a solution of a conventional\nsupergravity, in which case it necessarily has no Killing spinors. For example,\nde Sitter space can arise as a solution of N=8 gauged supergravities in four or\nfive dimensions. These lift to solutions of 11-dimensional supergravity or D=10\nIIB supergravity which are warped products of de Sitter space and non-compact\nspaces of negative curvature. In the second way, de Sitter space can arise as a\nsupersymmetric solution of an unconventional supergravity theory, which\ntypically has some kinetic terms with the `wrong' sign; such solutions are\ninvariant under a de Sitter supergroup. Such solutions lift to supersymmetric\nsolutions of unconventional supergravities in D=10 or D=11, which nonetheless\narise as field theory limits of theories that can be obtained from M-theory by\ntimelike T-dualities and related dualities.
