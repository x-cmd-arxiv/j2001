We define a new\ninvariant of a line bundle, called M-regularity index, which is seen to govern\nthe higher order properties and (partly conjecturally) the defining equations\nof such embeddings. We prove a general result on the behavior of higher\nsyzygies in embeddings given by multiples of ample bundles whose base locus has\nno fixed components, extending a conjecture of Lazarsfeld known to be true by\nwork of the first author. This approach also unifies essentially all the\npreviously known results in this direction and is mainly based on vanishing\ntheorems rather than representations of theta groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2001 22:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2003 18:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here we present an alternative strategy\ncalled direct linearization method (DLM). The DLM discretization algebraic\nequations of nonlinear PDE's is simply linear rather than nonlinear. The basic\nidea behind the DLM is that we see a nonlinear term as a new independent\nsystematic variable and transfer a nonlinear PDE into a linear PDE with more\nthan one independent variable. It is stressed that the DLM strategy can be\napplied combining any existing numerical discretization techniques. The\nresulting linear discretization equations can be either over-posed or\nwell-posed. In particular, we also discuss how to create proper radial basis\nfunctions in conjunction with the DLM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2001 12:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
