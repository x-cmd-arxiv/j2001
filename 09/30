We use a multi-zone single\ncollapse model. This model accounts for the observed blue cores by adopting a\nbroad spread in formation redshifts for ellipticals, allowing some of these\ngalaxies begin forming no more than ~1 Gyr before the redshift of observation.\nThe single-zone collapse model then produces cores that are bluer than the\nouter regions because of the increase of the local potential well toward the\ncenter which makes star-formation more extended in the central region of the\ngalaxy. We compare the predicted V-I(r) color gradients with the observed ones\nusing the redshift of formation ($z_F$) of the elliptical as the only free\nparameter. We find that the model can account with relatively good agreement\nfor the blue cores and inverse color gradients found in many spheroidals and at\nthe same time for the red and smooth colors profiles reported.

We then apply this result to the problem of\nmeasuring the energy of an unknown quantum state. It has been previously shown\nthat if the Hamiltonian is known, then the energy can in principle be measured\nin an arbitrarily short time. On the other hand we show that if the Hamiltonian\nis not known then an energy measurement necessarily takes a minimum time\n$\\Delta t$ which obeys the uncertainty relation $\\Delta t \\Delta E \\gtrsim 1$\nwhere $\\Delta E$ is the precision of the energy measurement. Several examples\nare studied to address the question of whether it is possible to saturate these\nuncertainty relations.
