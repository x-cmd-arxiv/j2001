The\ncuprates seems to exhibit statistics, dimensionality and phase transitions in\nnovel ways. The nature of excitations [i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must\nbe understood. The Hubbard model captures some of the behaviour of the phase\ntransitions in these materials. On the other hand the phases such as stripes in\nthese materials bear relationship to quantum group or string-like solutions.\nOne thus expects that the relevant solutions of Hubbard model may thus be\nwritten in terms of stringy solutions. In short this approach may lead to the\nnon-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard and other condensed matter\nHamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d based symmetry such as quantum\ngroups can be relevant in describing a 3-d [spatial dimensions] system such as\ncuprates. The answer lies in the key observation that strings which are 1-d\nobjects can be used to describe physics in $d$ dimensions. For example gravity\n[which is a 3-d [spatial] plus time] phenomenon can be understood in terms of\n1-d strings. Thus we expect that 1-d quantum group object induces physics in\n2-d and 3-d which may be relevant to the cuprates. We present support for our\ncontention using [numerical] variational Monte-Carlo [MC] applied to 2d d-p\nmodel. We also briefly discuss others ways to formulate a string picture for\ncuprates, namely by exploiting connection between gauge theories and strings\nand t'Hooft picture of quark confinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2001 08:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The graphs are grown from the evolution\nrules compatible with the dynamics of the world-wide Web [Tadi\\'c, Physica A\n{\\bf 293}, 273 (2001)], and are characterized by a pair of power-law\ndistributions of out- and in-degree for each value of the parameter $\\beta$,\nwhich measures the degree of rewiring in the graph. The walker adapts its move\nstrategy according to locally available information both on out-degree of the\nvisited node and in-degree of target node. A standard random walk, on the other\nhand, uses the out-degree only. We compute the distribution of connected\nsubgraphs visited by an ensemble of walkers, the average access time and\nsurvival probability of the walks. We discuss these properties of the walk\ndynamics relative to the changes in the global graph structure when the control\nparameter $\\beta $ is varied. For $\\beta \\geq 3$, corresponding to the\nworld-wide Web, the access time of the walk to a given level of hierarchy on\nthe graph is much shorter compared to the standard random walk on the same\ngraph.
