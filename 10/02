Evidence is\npresented for two types of progenitors. The radio afterglow of GRB 980425/SN\n1998bw and the multi-frequency observations of GRB 970508 can be fitted by a\nblast wave expanding into a wind-type medium, pointing to a massive star\nprogenitor. The broadband afterglow data of GRBs 990123 and 990510 are better\nmodeled by a jet expanding into a constant-density medium, implying a compact\nstar merger origin. Among other well observed GRBs, the jet model appears to be\nmore widely applicable than the wind model, although some cases are ambiguous.\nThe model fits often require a deviation of the energy distribution of the\nradiating electrons from the commonly assumed single power-law form,\nparticularly for sources with a rapid decline and/or pronounced steepening in\nthe optical light curves. Transition to non-relativistic evolution has been\nsuggested as an alternative explanation for the light curve steepening,\nalthough to produce steepening on the order of days or less would require very\nhigh ambient densities, which are generally difficult to reconcile with radio\nobservations. Major open issues include the hydrodynamics of jet-ambient medium\ninteraction, a self-consistent determination of the electron energy\ndistribution, and the effects of pair production on the early afterglows which\nare expected to be particularly large for the wind interaction model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2001 19:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is shown that major changes\ntake place in the blackbody emission component, the temperature kT_BB\nincreasing to ~2.2 keV in flaring. Remarkably, the blackbody area decreases by\na factor of ~5 in flaring. During flare evolution, the blackbody luminosity\nremains approximately constant, constituting a previously unknown Eddington\nlimiting effect which we propose is due to radiation pressure of the blackbody\nas kT_BB increases affecting the inner disk or accretion flow resulting in a\ndecreased emitting area on the star. We argue that the large decrease in area\ncannot be explained in terms of modification of the blackbody spectrum by\nelectron scattering in the atmosphere of the neutron star. The height of the\nemitting region on the non-flaring neutron star is shown to agree with the\nheight of the inner radiatively-supported disk as found for sources in the ASCA\nsurvey of LMXB of Church & Balucinska-Church (2001).

Although\nthis aspect has been widely recognized, a systematic analysis of the sampling\ninfluence is still lacking. Here we present the results of a systematic\nanalysis of synthetic self-affine profiles in order to clarify the consequences\nof the application of a poor sampling (up to 1000 points) typical of Scanning\nProbe Microscopy for the characterization of real interfaces and surfaces. We\ninterprete our results in term of a deviation and a dispersion of the measured\nexponent with respect to the ``true'' one. Both the deviation and the\ndispersion have always been disregarded in the experimental literature, and\nthis can be very misleading if results obtained from poorly sampled images are\npresented. We provide reasonable arguments to assess the universality of these\neffects and we propose an empirical method to take them into account. We show\nthat it is possible to correct the deviation of the measured Hurst exponent\nfrom the 'true' one and give a reasonable estimate of the dispersion error. The\nlast estimate is particularly important in the experimental results since it is\nan intrinsic error that depends only on the number of sampling points and can\neasily overwhelm the statistical error.

In the\nsame way, firms in the economy carry out strategies, and the net outcome of the\ninteractions between firms is to increase or decrease the fitness of other\nfirms.. Models which are used to describe the interactions of biological\nspecies can be given straightforward interpretations in terms of the\ninteractions of firms in an industry. The general versions of models of\ninteractions between agents allow for co-operative behaviour between pairs of\nagents. We contrast the properties of such a model with special cases of it, in\nwhich interactions are restricted so that only competitive interactions between\npairs of agents are permitted. Such pure economic competition (PEC) behaviour\nis regarded as desirable by economic theory, The properties of the two models\nare strikingly different.

Using the C-metric construction we\nderive the metric for an infinitisemally thin domain wall intersecting dilaton\nblack hole. The behavior of the domain wall in the spacetime of dilaton black\nhole was analyzed and it was revealed that the extereme dilaton black hole\nalways expelled the domain wall. We elaborated the back reaction problem and\nconcluded that topological kink solution smoothes out singularity of the\nconsidered topological defect. Finally we gave some comments concerning\nnucleation of dilaton black holes in the presence of the domain wall. We found\nthat domain walls would rather prefer to nucleate small black holes on them,\nthan large ones inside them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2001 09:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We begin with brief review of the governing matrix equation (for the\ndetailed discussion see Yakubovich, E.I. & Zenkovich, D.A. 2001 Matrix approach\nto Lagrangian fluid dynamics. J.

The new\ngeneral relationship between two- and three-dimensional solutions of the matrix\nequations is then found and applied to 3-D generalization of plane 'Ptolemaic'\nvortices. As a result, families of non-stationary swirling vortices and of\nstretched vortices in an axisymmetric strain are constructed and studied. The\nset of matrix equations is extended to include the effect of viscosity by\nincorporating an evolution equation for the Cauchy invariants, which represents\na lagrangian analogue of the Helmholtz equation for a viscous fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2001 19:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
