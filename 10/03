In particular we\npay attention to the role of the photosphere due to $e^\\pm$ pairs produced by\ninternal shock synchrotron photons. It is shown that the observed Cepheid-like\nrelationship between the luminosity and the variability can be interpreted as a\ncorrelation between the opening angle of the fireball jet and the mass included\nat the explosion with a standard energy output. We also show that such a\ncorrelation can be a natural consequence of the collapsar model. Using a\nmultiple-shell model, we numerically calculate the temporal profiles of\ngamma-ray bursts. Collimated jets, in which the typical Lorentz factors are\nhigher than in wide jets, can produce more variable temporal profiles due to\nsmaller angular spreading time scales at the photosphere radius. Our\nsimulations quantitatively reproduce the observed correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2001 13:13:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2002 13:19:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In one dimensional systems\ncoarsening is generally driven by an attractive interaction between domain\nwalls or kinks.

If surface slope increases indefinitely,\nthe deterministic equation looks like a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation: here\nwe study the late stage of coarsening through a linear stability analysis of\nthe stationary periodic configurations and through a direct numerical\nintegration. Analytical and numerical results agree with regard to the\nconclusion that steepening of mounds makes deterministic coarsening faster: if\nalpha is the exponent describing the steepening of the maximal slope M of\nmounds (M^alpha = L) we find that L(t)=t^n: n is equal to 1/4 for 1<alpha<2 and\nit decreases from 1/4 to 1/5 for alpha>2, according to n=alpha/(5*alpha -2).

In 1958\nPhillips made a conjecture that wave breaking is the main mechanism responsible\nfor the spectrum formation (Phillips, 1958). That leads to the spectrum decay\n$\\sim \\omega^{-5}$, where $\\omega$ is the frequency of waves. There is a\ncontradiction between the numerous experimental data and this spectrum.\nExperiments frequently show decay $\\sim\\omega^{-4}$ (Toba, 1973),(Donelan et\nal, 1985), and (Hwang et al, 1999). There are several ways of the explanation\nof this phenomenon. One of them (proposed by Banner (Banner, 1990)) takes into\naccount the Doppler effect due to surface circular currents generated by\nunderlying waves in the Phillips model.\n  In this article the influence of the Doppler effect on an arbitrary averaged\nspectrum is considered using both analytic and numerical approaches. Although\nwe mostly concentrated on the very important case of Phillips model the\ndeveloped technique and general formula can be used for the analysis of other\nspectra.\n  For the particular case of Phillips spectra we got analytic asymptotics in\nthe vicinity of spectral maximum and for high frequencies. Results were\nobtained for two most important angular dependences of the spectra: isotropic\nand strongly anisotropic. Together with the analytic investigation we performed\nnumerical calculations in a wide range of frequencies. Both high and low\nfrequency asymptotics are in very good agreement with the numerical results.\n  It was shown that at least at low frequencies correction to the spectrum due\nto the Doppler shift is negligible. At high frequencies there is an asymptotic\nwith tail $\\sim \\omega^{-3}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2001 09:45:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 May 2002 12:26:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Dec 2010 14:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-04"}
