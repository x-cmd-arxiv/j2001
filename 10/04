Up to now, in calculation of\nthe turbulent dynamo, it has been customary to assume that there is no the back\nreaction of the magnetic field on the turbulence, as long as the magnetic\nenergy is less than the turbulent kinetic energy. This assumption leads to the\nkinematic dynamo theory. However, the applicability of the kinematic dynamo\ntheory to protogalaxies is rather limited. The reason is that in protogalaxies\nthe temperature is very high, and the viscosity is dominated by ions. As the\nmagnetic field strength grows in time, the ion cyclotron time becomes shorter\nthan the ion collision time, and the plasma becomes strongly magnetized. As a\nresult, the ion viscosity becomes the Braginskii viscosity. Thus, in\nprotogalaxies the back reaction sets in much earlier, at field strengths much\nlower than the energy equipartition field strengths, and the turbulent dynamo\nbecomes what we call the magnetized turbulent dynamo. The purpose of this\nthesis is to lay the theoretical groundwork for the magnetized turbulent\ndynamo. In particular, we predict that the magnetic energy growth rate in the\nmagnetized dynamo theory is up to ten time larger than that in the kinematic\ndynamo theory. We also briefly discuss how the Braginskii viscosity can aid the\ndevelopment of the inverse cascade of magnetic energy after the energy\nequipartition time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2001 18:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The periods in V1405 Aql fit well within a\nnewly found relation where the ratio between the negative superhump deficit\n(over the orbital period) and the positive superhump excess is a function of\norbital period in cataclysmic variables that show both types of superhumps.\nTherefore, the 2979-s period is naturally interpreted as a negative superhump.\nThe recently found 4.8-d period in the X-ray light curve of V1405 Aql is\nconsequently understood as the precession of the accretion disc in the nodal\ndirection. This is the first firm detection of negative superhumps and nodal\nprecession in a LMXRB. Our results thus confirm the classification of V1405 Aql\nas a permanent superhump system. The 13-year argument on the nature of this\nintriguing object has thus finally come to an end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2001 02:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

At first, the nonlinear effective interatomic potential and the\ndifference equation for longitudinal lattice displacement are obtained for the\nSWCNTs by expanding Brenner's many-body potential in a Taylor series up to\nfourth-order terms. Then using a multi-scale method, for short wavelength\nlattice excitations the equation of motion of lattice is reduced to the cubic\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation. Finally, the dark soliton solutions and\nrelevant excitations in the SWCNTs with subsonic velocity are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2001 04:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Finally, we study the\nalgebra structure of the duals of our families, and show they are direct sums\nof Clifford algebras. Since there are finitely many types of Clifford algebras\nin each dimension, this allows us to construct nontrivial families of rigid\ntensor structures on the abelian category of modules over a finite dimensional\nalgebra, with a fixed Grothendieck ring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2001 16:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
