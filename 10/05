Dense and\nroughly spherical, it fills the space around the sgB[e] star, and, based on the\nsize of an infrared-emitting dust shell around the system, extends to a radius\nbetween 13 - 50 AU.

The compact star in CI Cam is immersed in the dense circumstellar wind\nfrom the sgB[e] star and burrows through the wind producing little X-ray\nemission except for rare transient outbursts. This picture (a compact star\ntraveling in a wide orbit through the dense circumstellar envelope of a sgB[e]\nstar, occasionally producing transient X-ray outbursts) makes CI Cam unique\namong the known X-ray binaries. Strong circumstantial evidence suggests that\nthe compact object is a black hole, not a neutron star.

The combined analysis of all Narrow Field Instruments\nprovides a power law spectral index of ~ 1.6 and confirms the flat spectral\nnature of this source. Although NGC 526A varies strongly in the 2-10 keV over\nperiod of months/years, its spectral shape remains constant over these\ntimescales. An Fe K-alpha line, characterized by a complex structure, has been\ndetected in the 6-7 keV range. The line, which has an equivalent width of 120\neV, is not compatible with being produced in an absorbing torus with N_H ~\n10^22 cm^-2, but most likely originates by reflection in an accretion disk\nviewed at an intermediate inclination angle of ~ 42 deg.

The inclusions with high concentration of junctions are associated with\nregions of suppressed mobility of chains that surround isolated clusters of\nfiller and its secondary network. The regions with low concentration of\njunctions arise during the mixing process due to the inhomogeneity in spatial\ndistribution of a cross-linker.

It is also shown, in the generic case,\nthat the group of Ricci collineations is six-dimensional and coincides with the\nisometry group. In special cases the spacetime may admit either one or four\nproper Ricci collineations in addition to the six isometries. These special\ncases are classified and the general form of the vector fields generating the\nRicci collineations is exhibited. When the Ricci tensor is degenerate, the\ngroups of Ricci inheritance collineations and Ricci collineations are\ninfinite-dimensional. General forms for the generating vectors are obtained.\nSimilar results are obtained for matter collineations and matter inheritance\ncollineations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2001 21:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, the eigenvalues in\nthe projected subspace exhibit a type of phase shift to the evolutionary\nstates. This phase shift does not destroy the decoherence-free (DF) property of\nthe subspace because the associated fidelity is 1. This permits a universal\nformalism to be presented - the eigenprojectors of the free part of the\nHamiltonian for the system and bath may be used to construct a DF projected\nsubspace based on the SKE.

The bounds for such region and for obtaining the nonvanished\nnonclassicality of the teleported quantum states are also discussed. Our model\nshows a reasonable agreement with the observed teleportation fidelity in the\nexperiment by Furusawa et al. [Science {\\bf 282}, 706 (1998)]. We finally\nmention the required conditions for transmitting nonclassical features in real\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2001 08:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
