We find a lower limit for the\nglobal stellar mass of about 500 Mo.

The FS-functions are best described in the super\nrealization of the algebra of symmetric functions. As supersymmetric functions,\nthe FS-functions can be characterized as a solution to an interpolation\nproblem.\n  Our main result is a simple determinantal formula for the transition\ncoefficients between the FS-functions and the Schur functions. We also\nestablish the FS analogs for a number of basic facts concerning the Schur\nfunctions: Jacobi-Trudi formula together with its dual form; combinatorial\nformula (expression in terms of tableaux); Giambelli formula and the\nSergeev-Pragacz formula.\n  All these results hold for a large family of bases interpolating between the\nFS-functions and the ordinary Schur functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2001 09:47:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
