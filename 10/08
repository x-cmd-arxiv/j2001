We present here a\nmethod of introducing Lagrangian coordinates into relativistic MHD equations in\ngeneral relativity, which enables a convenient mathematical formulation for the\nbehaviour of flux tubes. With the introduction of these Lagrangian, so--called\n``frozen--in'' coordinates, the relativistic MHD equations reduce to a set of\nnonlinear 1D string equations, and the plasma may therefore be regarded as a\ngas of nonlinear strings corresponding to flux tubes. Numerical simulation\nshows that if such a tube/string falls into a Kerr black hole, then the leading\nportion loses angular momentum and energy as the string brakes, and to\ncompensate for this loss, momentum and energy is radiated to infinity to\nconserve energy and momentum for the tube. Inside the ergosphere the energy of\nthe leading part turns out to be negative after some time, and the rest of the\ntube then gets energy from the hole. In our simulations most of the compensated\npositive energy is also localized inside the ergosphere because the inward\nspeed of the plasma is approximately equal to the velocity of the MHD wave\nwhich transports energy outside. Therefore, an additional physical process has\nto be included which can remove energy from the ergophere. Magnetic\nreconnection seems fills this role releasing Maxwellian stresses and producing\na relativistic jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2001 10:18:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Solar neutrinos from the decay of $^{8}$B have been\ndetected at SNO by the charged-current (CC) interaction on the deuteron and by\nthe elastic scattering (ES) of electrons.

A protocol with which one can\nget a pure entangled state from a mixed state is defined as purifying mixed\nstates. We address a basic question: can one get a pure entangled state from a\nmixed state? We give a necessary and sufficient condition of purifying a mixed\nstate by fit local operations and classical communication and show that for a\nclass of source states and ancilla states in arbitrary bipartite systems\npurifying mixed states is impossible by finite rounds of purifying protocols.\nFor $2\\otimes 2$ systems, it is proved that arbitrary states cannot be purified\nby individual measurement. The possible application and meaning of the\nconclusion are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2001 09:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This is more meaningful\nin practical application. We give a necessary and sufficient condition of this\ndistillability. This condition can be expressed as: there exists\ndistillable-subspaces. According to this condition, one can judge whether a\nmixed state is distillable or not easily. We also analyze some properties of\ndistillable-subspaces, and discuss the most efficient purification protocols.\nFinally, we discuss the distillable enanglement of two-quibt system for the\ncase of finite copies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2001 09:48:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2002 01:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
