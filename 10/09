A complete analytic analysis is given for\neach stage. Some very interesting new problems brought by this collapse are\ndiscussed. Therefore our model avoids naturally the future event horizon\nproblem of the present accelerative expanding universe and maybe realize the\ninfinite cycles of the universe, which supplies a mechanism to use naturally\nthe anthropic principle. This paper shows that the understanding on the essence\nof the cosmological constant should contain a richer content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2001 21:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We have previously found\nthat for about half of these decays, the instantaneous photon flux ~ 1/time,\nwhich is a consequence of the validity of both a power-law hardness-intensity\ncorrelation (HIC) and an exponential hardness-fluence correlation (HFC). Here,\nwe study a complete sample of 25 BATSE pulses (having a peak flux in 1 s\nresolution of > 5 photons/s/cm^2 and a S/N of 30 in at least 8 time bins) and,\nspecifically, search for other types of decay behaviors. First, we find that a\npower law gives a better description of the pulse decays than a stretched\nexponential, the most commonly assumed pulse shape so far. Then we find that\nabout half of the decays behave approximately as 1/time, and the other half\napproximately as 1/time^3. For a few of the latter decays, the two\ncorrelations, the HIC and the HFC, are constrained and found to be consistent\nwith the light curve behavior. For these cases, the HIC is still a power law\nwhile the HFC is described by a generalized function. Finally, we briefly\ndiscuss our results in a physical context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2001 01:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\nangular resolution of the data is 4.0x2.7 arcmin, and the rms noise of the\norder of 30 mJy/beam (~0.5 K). The HI observations indicate that the N-NW radio\nlimb has encountered a dense HI filament (density ~12 cm^-3) at the same LSR\nvelocity than that of the SNR (V_LSR ~ -68 km/s). This HI concentration would\nbe responsible for the flattened shape of the NW lobe of G320.4-1.2, and for\nthe formation of the radio/optical/X-ray nebula RCW 89. The emission associated\nwith the bright knots in the interior of RCW 89 can be explained as arising\nfrom the interaction between the collimated relativistic outflow from the\npulsar and the denser part of this HI filament (density ~15 cm^-3). The S-SE\nhalf of the SNR, on the other hand, seems to have rapidly expanded across a\nlower density enviroment (density ~0.4 cm^-3).

We found that if radio-loudness is measured using the\noptical and radio luminosities of the nuclear components, the black hole masses\nof radio-loud Seyfert 1s tend to increase with the radio-loudness. The black\nhole masses of all Seyfert galaxies increase with the radio power, but Seyfert\ngalaxies have larger radio powers than nearby galaxies with the same black hole\nmasses. In addition, the correlation between black hole masses and bulge V-band\nluminosities for Seyfert galaxies is consistent with that found for quasars and\nnormal galaxies. The combined sample of 37 Seyfert galaxies, 15 quasars and 30\nnormal galaxies suggests a possible universal nonlinear relation between black\nhole and bulge masses, $M(BH) \\propto M(bulge)^{1.74\\pm0.14}$, which is\nslightly steeper than that found recently by Laor (2001) for a smaller sample.\nThis nonlinear relation is supported by a larger sample including 65 Seyfert\ngalaxies. The different M(BH)/M(bulge) ratio for galaxies with different bulge\nluminosities or different black hole masses may be explained by this relation.\nThese results are consistent with some theoretical implications and are\nimportant for understanding the nature of radio emissions and the formation and\nevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2001 15:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In particular, we report on the accuracy of our code in the\nlong-term dynamical evolution of relativistic stars and on some new physics\nresults obtained in the process of code testing. The tests involve single\nnon-rotating stars in stable equilibrium, non-rotating stars undergoing radial\nand quadrupolar oscillations, non-rotating stars on the unstable branch of the\nequilibrium configurations migrating to the stable branch, non-rotating stars\nundergoing gravitational collapse to a black hole, and rapidly rotating stars\nin stable equilibrium and undergoing quasi-radial oscillations. The numerical\nevolutions have been carried out in full general relativity using different\ntypes of polytropic equations of state using either the rest-mass density only,\nor the rest-mass density and the internal energy as independent variables. New\nvariants of the spacetime evolution and new high resolution shock capturing\n(HRSC) treatments based on Riemann solvers and slope limiters have been\nimplemented and the results compared with those obtained from previous methods.\nFinally, we have obtained the first eigenfrequencies of rotating stars in full\ngeneral relativity and rapid rotation.
