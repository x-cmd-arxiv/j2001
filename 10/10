Given the\nrecent emerging evidence that the irradiation from white dwarfs in VY Scl-type\nsystems affect their light behavior, we propose a possibility that this unique\nvariation in V425 Cas can be explained by the combination of the dwarf\nnova-type disk instability and irradiation. Similar short-period \"outbursts\"\nhave been known in X-ray transients (V518 Per), and helium cataclysmic\nvariables (CR Boo and V803 Cen). We discuss the possibility that these\nphenomena have a common origin to the unique variation in V425 Cas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2001 08:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Senovilla defined a universal\nalgebraic construction which generates a basic superenergy tensor T{A} from any\narbitrary tensor A. In this construction the seed tensor A is structured as an\nr-fold multivector, which can always be done. The most important feature of the\nbasic superenergy tensors is that they satisfy automatically the DP,\nindependently of the generating tensor A. In a previous paper we presented a\nmore compact definition of T{A} using the r-fold Clifford algebra.

It is shown that the interference between\ncomponent states leads to non-classical oscillations in the photon number\ndistribution. At mid revival time the field is almost in the pure state.\n  We have briefly discussed the evolution of the Q function of the cavity\nfield.
