So that the WDs are able to grow up to the\nChandrasekhar mass and explode as an SN Ia, showing SSS or recurrent nova\nphenomena in the way to SNe Ia. Thus, the accretion wind process of WDs can\nopen new channels to SNe Ia. We have modeled the LMC supersoft source RX\nJ0513.9-6951 as an example of the systems in the accretion wind phase. Further\ninclusions of two other elementary processes make the channels much wider;\nthese are the case BB mass transfer in the SSS channel and the strong orbital\nshrinkage during the superwind phase of the primary star in the symbiotic\nchannel. As a result, the estimated birth rate of SNe Ia via these two channels\nbecomes compatible with the observation in our Galaxy. Interestingly, the U Sco\nand T CrB subclasses of recurrent novae can be naturally understood as a part\nof evolutionary stages in these two SSS and symbiotic channels to SNe Ia,\nrespectively.

The results show that the mass of the white dwarf (WD) is as massive as\n1.35 \\pm 0.01 M_\\sun; the envelope mass of the WD at the optical maximum is ~ 6\nx 10^{-6} M_\\sun; the hydrogen content of the WD envelope is as low as X ~ 0.1\nby mass weight. The mass transfer rate in quiescence is roughly estimated to be\n\\~ 1.5 x 10^{-7} M_\\sun yr^{-1} and, therefore, that the recurrence period of\nnova outbursts is about 40 yr. Since the WD mass may be now growing at a rate\nof ~ 2 x 10^{-8} M_\\sun yr^{-1}, V2487 Oph is a strong candidate for a\nprogenitor of a Type Ia supernova.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2001 06:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In light elements, emission of an Auger electron is\ncommon. However, the energy and the total number of electrons released from the\natom may be modulated by shake-up and shake-off effects. When the inner-shell\nelectron leaves, the outer-shell electrons may find themselves in a state that\nis not an eigen-state of the atom in its surroundings. The resulting collective\nexcitation is called shake-up. If this process also involves the release of low\nenergy electrons from the outer shell, then the process is called shake-off.

We\nbelieve that Computational Mechanics cannot be applied to a noisy and finite\ndata series without invoking an argument based upon effective soficity. A\nrelated distinction between noise and randomness is also defined: Noise can\nonly be eliminated by increasing the length of the time series, whereas the\nresolution of random structure only requires the finite memory of the analysis\nto be increased. The benefits of these new concepts are demonstrated on\nsimulated times series by (a) the effective elimination of white noise\ncorruption from a periodic signal using the expletive filter and (b) the\nappearance of an effectively sofic region in the statistical complexity of a\nbiased Poisson switch time series that is insensitive to changes in the\nwordlength (memory) used in the analysis.

Compared to an HMM, this FST cascade has\nthe advantage of significantly higher processing speed, but at the cost of\nslightly lower accuracy. Applications such as Information Retrieval, where the\nspeed can be more important than accuracy, could benefit from this approach.\n  In the process of tagging, we first assign every word a unique ambiguity\nclass c_i that can be looked up in a lexicon encoded by a sequential FST. Every\nc_i is denoted by a single symbol, e.g. [ADJ_NOUN], although it represents a\nset of alternative tags that a given word can occur with. The sequence of the\nc_i of all words of one sentence is the input to our FST cascade. It is mapped\nby T1, from left to right, to a sequence of reduced ambiguity classes r_i.\nEvery r_i is denoted by a single symbol, although it represents a set of\nalternative tags. Intuitively, T1 eliminates the less likely tags from c_i,\nthus creating r_i. Finally, T2 maps the sequence of r_i, from right to left, to\na sequence of single POS tags t_i. Intuitively, T2 selects the most likely t_i\nfrom every r_i.\n  The probabilities of all t_i, r_i, and c_i are used only at compile time, not\nat run time.

One of\nthe ideas behind this work concerns the analysis of the effects that the\ngravity--induced quantum noise, stemming from the bodies in the neighborhood of\nthe Paul trap, could have upon the enhancement of the quantum behavior of this\nsystem. This will be done considering a series expansion for the gravitational\nfield of the source, and including in the Hamiltonian of the Paul trap only the\nfirst two terms. Higher--order contributions will be introduced as part of the\nenvironment of the system, and in consequence will not appear in the\nHamiltonian. In other words, we put forward an argument that allows us to\ndifferentiate those gravitational degrees of freedom that will appear as an\nuncontrollable influence on the Paul trap. Along the ideas of the so called\nrestricted path integral formalism, we take into account the continuous\nmonitoring of the position of our particle, and in consequence the\ncorresponding propagators and probabilities, associated with the different\nmeasurements outputs, are obtained.\n  Afterwards, the differential equation related to a quantum nondemolition\nvariable is posed and solved, i.e., a family of quantum nondemolition\nparameters is obtained. Finally, a qualitative analysis of the effects on the\nsystem, of the gravity--induced environment, will be done.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2001 20:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

The present mechanism of instability of electrically neutral\nmolecules is different from that of the well-known Smith-Purcell and transition\nradiation in which a moving charge and its oscillating image create an\noscillating dipole.\n  We show that parametrically excited molecular bunches can produce an easily\ndetectable coherent radiation flux of up to a microwatt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2001 21:21:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
