Neither approach appears to scale well to richer\nlanguages with unit types or subtyping, and neither directly addresses the\nproblem of conversion to canonical.\n  In this paper we present a new, type-directed equivalence algorithm for the\nLF type theory that overcomes the weaknesses of previous approaches. The\nalgorithm is practical, scales to richer languages, and yields a new notion of\ncanonical form sufficient for adequate encodings of logical systems. The\nalgorithm is proved complete by a Kripke-style logical relations argument\nsimilar to that suggested by Coquand. Crucially, both the algorithm itself and\nthe logical relations rely only on the shapes of types, ignoring dependencies\non terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2001 16:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We present a unified description of optimal decompositions of\nquantum states and the optimization of witness operators that detect whether a\ngiven state belongs to a given convex set. We illustrate the abstract\nformulation with several examples, and discuss relations between optimal\nentanglement witnesses and n-copy non-distillable states with non-positive\npartial transpose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2001 13:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
