A major nutrient with a fluctuating abundance is nitrogen. The\ngrowth rate of enteric bacteria under nitrogen-limiting conditions is known to\ncorrelate with the internal concentration of free glutamine, the glutamine\npool. Here we compare the patterns of utilization of L-glutamine and\nL-glutamate, the two central intermediates of nitrogen metabolism. Monomeric\nprecursors of all of the cell's macromolecules -- proteins, nucleic acids, and\nsurface polymers -- require the amide group of glutamine at the first dedicated\nstep of biosynthesis. This is the case even though only a minority (~12%) of\ntotal cell nitrogen derives from glutamine. In contrast, the amino group of\nglutamate, which provides the remainder of cell nitrogen, is generally required\nlate in biosynthetic pathways, e.g. in transaminase reactions for amino acid\nsynthesis. We propose that the pattern of glutamine dependence coordinates the\ndecrease in biosynthesis under conditions of nitrogen limitation. Hence, the\nglutamine pool plays a global regulatory role in the cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2001 21:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It\nis shown that in all legitimate cases, the evolution of $D_{1}$ states reduces\nto the disentangled evolution of the component $D_{2}$ states. The\nself-consistency conditions for the latter amount to conditions for\ndecoherence-free propagation, which complement the $D_{2}$ Davydov soliton\nequations in such a way as to lift the nonlinearity of the evolution for the\non-site degrees of freedom. Although it cannot support Davydov solitons, the\ncoherent-product ansatz does provide a wide class of exact density-matrix\nsolutions for the joint evolution of the lattice and phonon bath in compatible\nsystems.
