We will give a classification of all\nrectifiable bundles of circles containing sufficiently many circles in general\nposition. This result is surprisingly different from those in dimensions 2 and\n3(Khovanskii and Izadi) due to a connection with the quaternionic algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2001 04:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Every spreading model\nof X is an asymptotic model of X and in most settings, such as if X is\nreflexive, every normalized block basis of an asymptotic model is itself an\nasymptotic model.
