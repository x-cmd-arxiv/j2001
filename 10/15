There are at least four, maybe five, field reversals from the Norma\narm to the outskirts of our Galaxy. In the thick disk or Galactic halo, large\nscale toroidal magnetic fields, with opposite field directions in the Southern\nand Northern Galaxy, have been revealed by the antisymmetric RM sky towards the\ninner Galaxy. This signature of the A0 dynamo-mode field structure is\nstrengthened by the indication of a poloidal field of dipole form, that is the\ntransition of the RM signs probably shifted from $l\\sim0\\degr$ to\n$l\\sim+10\\degr$. The local vertical field is probably a part of this dipole\nfield. The field structure of the A0 dynamo-mode strikingly continues towards\nthe region near the GC. In short, the magnetic fields in the Galactic disk have\na bisymmetric spiral structure of primordial nature, while in the halo and near\nthe GC the A0 dynamo seems to dominate, so that the fields consist of toroidal\nfields with opposite directions below and above the Galactic plane and poloidal\nfields of dipole form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2001 18:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For weakly segregated blocks, below a\ncritical value of the field, E_c, surface interactions stabilize stacking of\nlamellae in a direction parallel to the surfaces. Above the critical field, a\nfirst-order phase transition occurs when lamellae in a direction perpendicular\nto the confining surfaces (and parallel to the field) become stable. The film\nmorphology is then a superposition of parallel and perpendicular lamellae. In\ncontrast to Helfrich-Hurault instability for smectic liquid crystals, the mode\nthat gets critical first has the natural lamellar periodicity. In addition,\nundulations of adjacent inter-material dividing surfaces are out-of-phase with\neach other.

So, the apparent novelity of the sciences of complexity seems to\nbe not situated in its fundamental ideas, but in the use of mathematical and\ncomputational models for illustrate, test and develop such ideas. Since\npoliticians as the candidate Al Gore recently declared that the sciences of\ncomplexity have influenced strongly their worldview, perhaps it could be\ninteresting to know better the ideas and the ideology related to the notion of\ncomplex adaptive systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2001 19:43:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2017 00:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-02"}

However, it\nseems a difficult task in the case of coherent attack, i.e., Eve may treat a\nnumber of intercepted qubits collectively, including the collective unitary\ntransformations and the measurements.

For this type of protocols(so far almost all QKD\nprotocols belong to this type), in principle no coherent attack is more\npowerful than the product of optimized individual attack to each individual\nqubits.
