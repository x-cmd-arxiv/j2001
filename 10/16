Measurement\nbiases are understood with mock catalogs which reproduce all of the observed\nscaling relations. At any given redshift, the intrinsic distribution of\nluminosities, sizes and velocity dispersions in our sample are all\napproximately Gaussian. In the r* band L ~ V^3.91, L ~ R^1.58, R ~ I^(-0.75),\nand the Fundamental Plane relation is R ~ V^(1.49) I^(-0.75). These relations\nare approximately the same in the g*, i* and z* bands.

Chemical evolution and star\nformation histories are investigated using co-added spectra of similar objects\nin our sample. Chemical abundances correlate primarily with velocity\ndispersion. At fixed V, the higher redshift population is bluer, is weaker in\nMg2, and is stronger in Hbeta than the population nearby.

A stellar disk and bulge component and a dark halo\nwas realized with collisionless particles, the gas was represented by SPH\nparticles. Since we did not include star formation we focused on the gas\ndynamics and its influence on the structure of merger remnants. We find that\nequal-mass mergers are in general more effective in driving gas to the center.\nAround 50% of the gas resides in the central regions after the merger is\ncomplete. The gas in unequal-mass mergers keeps a large amount of its initial\nangular momentum and settles in a large scale disk while only 20% -30% of the\ngas is driven to the center. This general result is almost independent of the\nmerger geometry. The gas in the outer regions accumulates in dense knots within\ntidal tails which could lead to the formation of open clusters or dwarf\nsatellites. Later on, the gas knots loose angular momentum by dynamical\nfriction and successively sink to the center of the remnant thereby increasing\nthe total gas content of the disk. Due to the influence of the gas the\nsimulated merger remnant becomes more oblate than its pure stellar counterpart.\nThe shape of the stellar LOSVD changes and the third-order Gauss-Hermite\ncoefficient $h_3$ is in good agreement with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2001 15:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For Coulomb interaction, we\ndemonstrate that the TDOS vanishes linearly at the Fermi level according to a\nquantum Coulomb gap form with a nonuniversal slope. For short-range\ninteractions, the TDOS is found to follow a power-law with an exponent\nproportional to the interaction strength. Since short-range interactions are\nknown to be irrelevant perturbations at the non-interacting critical point, we\npredict that upon scaling, the power-law is smeared, leading to a finite zero\nbias TDOS. However, the approach to the zero-bias value is described by a\npower-law with a universal exponent determined by the scaling dimension of\nshort-range interactions. We also consider the case of quasi-1D samples with\nedges and find that the TDOS becomes dependent of the Hall conductance due to\nan altered boundary condition for diffusion. For short-range interactions, the\nTDOS of a quasi-1D strip is linear near the Fermi level with a slope inversely\nproportional to the resistivity in the perturbative limit.

We concentrate on two specific models. The first is\nthe massive Wess-Zumino model which we study in a selfconsistent one-loop\napproximation. We find that for energy densities above a certain threshold, the\nfields are driven dynamically to a point in field space at which the fermionic\ncomponent of the superfield is massless. The state, however is found to be\nunstable, indicating a breakdown of the one-loop approximation. To investigate\nfurther, we consider an O(N) massive chiral model which is solved exactly in\nthe large $N$ limit. For sufficiently high energy densities, we find that for\nlate times the fields reach a nonperturbative minimum of the effective\npotential degenerate with the perturbative minimum. This minimum is a true\nattractor for O(N) invariant states at high energy densities, and this provides\na mechanism for determining which of the otherwise degenerate vacua is chosen\nby the dynamics. The final state for large energy density is a cloud of\nmassless particles (both bosons and fermions) around this new nonperturbative\nsupersymmetric minimum. By introducing boson masses which softly break the\nsupersymmetry, we demonstrate a see-saw mechanism for generating small fermion\nmasses.

The\nanalysis is carried out in the context of systems of ordinary differential\nequations with multiple time scales and geometric singular perturbation theory.\nA small parameter $\\eps$ measures the separation of time scales.

From the present preliminary\nresults it appears that it is possible to realize a useful quantum simulator\nwith a register of only 10-15 qbits. The intrinsic sensitivity to some errors\nappears to be moderate without the need of error correcting methods. At present\nthere is at least some indication that the amplitude errors are more dangerous\nthan phase and decoherence errors. So corrections limited to amplitude errors\nmay be very useful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2001 15:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
