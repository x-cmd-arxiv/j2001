Both classes of models probably\nhave sufficient baryonic mass in the central 3.5kpc to reproduce recent\nobservational values of the optical depth to microlensing events towards the\nGalactic center. All models require that about 1/2 of all baryons expected\ninside the virial radius must not be in the disk or bulge. We investigate\nwhether the range of virial masses allowed by our dynamical models is\ncompatible with constraints from the galaxy luminosity function, and find a\nrange of parameter space that is allowed by this constraint. We conclude that\nrotation curves and dynamical properties of ``normal'' high surface brightness\nspiral galaxies appear to be consistent with standard LCDM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2001 23:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

For p(D)+A collisions we\ncalculate nuclear shadowing and investigate nuclear modification of the DY\ntransverse momentum distribution at RHIC and LHC for kinematics corresponding\nto coherence length much longer than the nuclear size. Calculations are\nperformed separately for transversely and longitudinally polarized DY photons,\nand predictions are presented for the dilepton angular distribution.\nFurthermore, we calculate nuclear broadening of the mean transverse momentum\nsquared of DY dileptons as function of the nuclear mass number and energy. We\nalso predict nuclear effects for the cross section of the DY process in heavy\nion collisions. We found a substantial nuclear shadowing for valence quarks,\nstronger than for the sea.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2001 21:33:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2002 19:48:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2002 17:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

However, for large longitudinal separations, the generated\ninteraction grows only as the square root of the longitudinal separation and\nhence produces violations of rotational symmetry in the spectrum. We carry out\nnumerical studies in the G{\\l}azek-Wilson and Wegner formalisms and present low\nlying eigenvalues and wavefunctions. We investigate the sensitivity of the\nspectra to various parameterizations of the similarity factor and other\nparameters of the effective Hamiltonian, especially the scale $\\sigma$.

We assume that each two-state system (qubit)\nsuffers \\sigma_{z} error with probability p (0\\leq p\\leq 1) independently at\nevery step in the algorithm. Considering an n-qubit density operator to which\nGrover's operation is applied M times, we expand it in powers of 2Mnp and\nderive its matrix element order by order under the n\\to \\infty limit. (In this\nlarge n limit, we assume p is small enough, so that 2Mnp(\\geq 0) can take any\nreal positive value or 0.) This approach gives us an interpretation about\ncreation of new modes caused by \\sigma_{z} error and an asymptotic form of an\narbitrary order correction. Calculating the matrix element up to the fifth\norder term numerically, we investigate a region of 2Mnp (perturbative\nparameter) where the algorithm finds the correct item with a threshold of\nprobability P_{th} or more.

Recently it has been\nrealized that quantum entanglement is a key ingredient in quantum computation,\nquantum communication and quantum cryptography ([16],[17],[6]). In this paper,\nwe introduce algebraic sets, which are determinantal varieties in the complex\nprojective spaces or the products of complex projective spaces, for the mixed\nstates in bipartite or multipartite quantum systems as their invariants under\nlocal unitary transformations. These invariants are naturally arised from the\nphysical consideration of measuring mixed states by separable pure states. In\nthis way algebraic geometry and complex differential geometry of these\nalgebraic sets turn to be powerful tools for the understanding of quantum\nenatanglement. Our construction has applications in the following important\ntopics in quantum information theory: 1) separability criterion, it is proved\nthe algebraic sets have to be the sum of the linear subspaces if the mixed\nstates are separable; 2) lower bound of Schmidt numbers, that is, generic low\nrank bipartite mixed states are entangled in many degrees of freedom; 3)\nsimulation of Hamiltonians, it is proved the simulation of semi-positive\nHamiltonians of the same rank implies the projective isomorphisms of the\ncorresponding algebraic sets; 4) construction of bound enatanglement, examples\nof the entangled mixed states which are invariant under partial transpositions\n(thus PPT bound entanglement) are constructed systematically from our new\nseparability criterion.
