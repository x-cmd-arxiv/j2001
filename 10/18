In this paper we describe a remarkably simple real-time\nsimulation, based on just five simple rewriting rules, of any fixed number $k$\nof independent counters. On a Turing machine with a single, binary work tape,\nthe simulation runs in real time, handling an arbitrary counter command at each\nstep. The space used by the simulation can be held to $(k+\\epsilon) \\log_2 n$\nbits for the first $n$ commands, for any specified $\\epsilon > 0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2001 13:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
