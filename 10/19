Since\ngroups are abundant and therefore have a large covering fraction on the sky,\nlensing by groups is likely to be very important observationally. Besides, it\nhas recently become clear that many lens models for strong lensing by\nindividual galaxies require external shear to reproduce the observed image\ngeometries; in many cases a nearby group is detected that could provide this\nshear. In this work, we study the expected lensing behavior of galaxy groups in\nboth the weak and strong lensing regime. We examine the shear and magnification\nproduced by a group and its dependence on the detailed mass distribution within\nthe group. We find that the peak value of the weak lensing shear signal is of\nthe order of 3 per cent and varies by a factor of about 2 for different mass\ndistributions. These variations are large enough to be detectable in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS). In the strong lensing regime we find that the image\ngeometries and typical magnifications are sensitive to the group properties and\nthat groups can easily provide enough external shear to produce quadruple\nimages. We investigate the statistical properties of lensing galaxies that are\nnear or part of a group and find that statistical lens properties, like the\ndistribution of time delays, are affected measurably by the presence of the\ngroup which can therefore introduce an additional systematic error in the\nmeasurement of the Hubble constant from such systems.

The treatment of time-irreversible evolution (the\narrow of time) is therefore ruled out by definition in Quantum Mechanics. In\nQuantum Field Theory it is, however, possible to describe time-irreversible\nevolution by resorting to the existence of infinitely many unitarily\ninequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations (ccr). In\nthis paper I review such a result by discussing the canonical quantization of\nthe damped harmonic oscillator (dho), a prototype of dissipative systems. The\nirreversibility of time evolution is expressed as tunneling among the unitarily\ninequivalent representations. The exact action for the dho is derived in the\npath integral formalism of the quantum Brownian motion developed by Schwinger\nand by Feynman and Vernon. The doubling of the phase-space degrees of freedom\nfor dissipative systems is related to quantum noise effects.

This vorticity surge event is tied to the formation of the energy\ncascade in a direct numerical simulation by the traditional signatures of a\nturbulent energy cascade such as spectra approaching -5/3 and strongly\nBeltramized vortex tubes. A coherent mechanism is suggested by the nearly\nsimultaneous development of a maximum of the peak vorticity\n$\\|\\omega\\|_\\infty$, growth of the dissipation, the appearance of a helically\naligned local vortex configuration and strong, transient oscillations in the\nhelicity wavenumber spectrum.
