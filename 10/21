In this paper, we apply\nthe same technique to the galaxy sample extracted from V-band data and compare\nthe new cluster detections with the original ones. We find that ~75% of the\nlow-redshift cluster candidates (z<0.6) are detected in both passbands and\ntheir estimated redshifts show good agreement with the scatter in the redshift\ndifferences being consistent with the estimated errors of the method. For the\n``robust'' I-band detections the matching frequency approaches ~85%. We also\nuse the available (V-I) color to search for the red sequence of early-type\ngalaxies observed in rich clusters over a broad range of redshifts. This is\ndone by searching for a simultaneous overdensity in the three-dimensional\ncolor-projected distance space. We find significant overdensities for ~75% of\nthe ``robust'' candidates with z_I<0.6. We find good agreement between the\ncharacteristic color associated to the detected \"red sequence\" and that\npredicted by passive evolution galaxy models for ellipticals at the redshift\nestimated by the matched-filter. The results presented in this paper show the\nusefulness of color data, even of two-band data, to both tentatively confirm\ncluster candidates and to select possible cluster members for spectroscopic\nobservations.

Particular attention is paid to the issue of the\nbremsstrahlung detection threshold. It is shown that the radiative corrections\nto the total cross section for the charged current reaction are independent of\nthat threshold, as they must be for consistency, and amount to a slowly\ndecreasing function of the neutrino energy $E_{\\nu}$, varying from $\\sim$ 4% at\nlow energies to $\\sim$ 3% at the end of the $^8$B spectrum. The differential\ncross section corrections, on the other hand, do depend on the bremsstrahlung\ndetection threshold. Various choices of the threshold are discussed. It is\nshown that for a realistic choice of the threshold, and for the actual electron\nenergy threshold of the SNO detector, the deduced $^8$B $\\nu_e$ flux should be\ndecreased by $\\sim$ 2%. The radiative corrections to the neutral current\nreaction are also evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2001 22:22:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2001 21:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
