Fast-roll inflation can be useful for\ngenerating proper initial conditions for the subsequent stage of slow-roll\ninflation in the very early universe. It may also be responsible for the\npresent stage of accelerated expansion of the universe. We also make two\nobservations of a more general nature. First of all, the universe after a long\nstage of inflation (either slow-roll or fast-roll) cannot reach anti-de Sitter\nregime even if the cosmological constant is negative. Secondly, the theories\nwith the potentials with a \"stable\" minimum at V(\\phi)<0 in the cosmological\nbackground exhibit the same instability as the theories with potentials\nunbounded from below. This instability leads to the development of singularity\nwith the properties practically independent of V(\\phi). However, the\ndevelopment of the instability in some cases may be so slow that the theories\nwith the potentials unbounded from below can describe the present stage of\ncosmic acceleration even if this acceleration occurs due to the fast-roll\ninflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2001 18:55:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2001 02:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We demonstrate\nhow the increase of transferred energies in these reactions opens a complete\nnew window in studying the microscopic nuclear structure at small distances.\nThe simplifications in theoretical descriptions associated with the increase of\nthe energies are discussed. The theoretical framework for calculation of high\nenergy nuclear reactions based on the effective Feynman diagram rules is\ndescribed in details. The result of this approach is the generalized eikonal\napproximation (GEA), which is reduced to Glauber approximation when nucleon\nrecoil is neglected. The method of GEA is demonstrated in the calculation of\nhigh energy electro-disintegration of the deuteron and A=3 targets.\nSubsequently we generalize the obtained formulae for A>3 nuclei. The relation\nof GEA to the Glauber theory is analyzed. Then based on the GEA framework we\ndiscuss some of the phenomena which can be studied in exclusive reactions,\nthese are: nuclear transparency and short-range correlations in nuclei. We\nillustrate how light-cone dynamics of high-energy scattering emerge naturally\nin high energy electro-nuclear reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2001 20:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The impedance approach allows one\nto find the Casimir force between the realistic test bodies regardless of the\nelectromagnetic fluctuations inside the media. Although this approach is an\napproximate one, it has wider areas of application than the Lifshitz theory of\nthe Casimir force. The general formulas of the impedance approach to the theory\nof the Casimir force are given and the formal substitution is found for\nconnecting it with the Lifshitz formula. The range of micrometer separations\nbetween the test bodies which is interesting from the experimental point of\nview is investigated in detail. It is shown that at zero temperature the\nresults obtained on the basis of the surface impedance method are in agreement\nwith those obtained in framework of the Lifshitz theory within a fraction of a\npercent. The temperature correction to the Casimir force from the impedance\nmethod coincides with that from the Lifshitz theory up to four significant\nfigures. The case of millimeter separations which corresponds to the normal\nskin effect is also considered. At zero temperature the obtained results have\ngood agreement with the Lifshitz theory. At nonzero temperature the impedance\napproach is not subject to the interpretation problems peculiar to the\nzero-frequency term of the Lifshitz formula in dissipative media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2001 14:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
