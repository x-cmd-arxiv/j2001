The\nnoise kernel is the expectation value of the stress-energy bi-tensor which\ndescribes the fluctuations of quantum matter fields. Here, we first give an\naxiomatic derivation of the Einstein-Langevin equations and then show how they\ncan also be derived by the original method based on the influence functional.\nAs a first application we solve these equations and compute the two- point\ncorrelation functions for the linearized Einstein tensor and for the metric\nperturbations in a Minkowski background.

The elementary amplitude on a\nsingle nucleon is calculated from the unitary K-matrix approach developed\npreviously. Modifications of the properties of the delta resonance due to the\nnuclear medium are accounted for through the self-energy operator of the delta,\ncalculated from the one-pion loop. The dominant medium effects such as the\nPauli blocking, mean-field modification of the nucleon and delta masses, and\nparticle-hole excitations in the pion propagator are consistently included in\nnuclear matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2001 13:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
