We choose two radial bins, 1'-3' and 8'-16'\n(8'-14' for EMOS; hereafter the central and the outer zones), where the\ntemperature is almost constant, to carry out the detailed abundance\nmeasurements of O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe and Ni using EPIC-PN (EPN) and\n-MOS (EMOS) data. First, we find that the element abundance pattern in the\ncentral compared to the outer zone in M87 is characterized by SN Ia enrichment\nof a high (roughly solar) ratio of Si-group elements (Si, S, Ar, Ca) to Fe,\nimplying that Si burning in SN Ia is highly incomplete. In nucleosynthesis\nmodeling this is associated with either a lower density of the\ndeflagration-detonation transition and/or lower C/O and/or lower central\nignition density and observationally detected as optically subluminous SNe Ia\nin early-type galaxies. Second, we find that SN Ia enrichment has a\nsystematically lower ratio of the Si-group elements to Fe by 0.2 dex in the\nouter zone associated with the ICM of the Virgo cluster. We find that such a\nratio and even lower values by another 0.1 dex are a characteristic of the ICM\nin many clusters using observed Si:S:Fe ratios as found with ASCA. Third, the\nNi/Fe ratio in the central zone of M87 is 1.5+/-0.3 solar (meteoritic), while\nvalues around 3 times solar are reported for other clusters. In modeling of SN\nIa, this implies a reduced influence of fast deflagration SN Ia models in the\nchemical enrichment of M87's ISM. Thus, to describe the SN Ia metal enrichment\nin clusters, both deflagration as well as delayed detonation scenarios are\nrequired, supporting a similar conclusion, derived from optical studies on SNe\nIa.

Under these conditions the\nsimulationist makes a judicious choice of one of these alternatives and embeds\nthis choice in the simulation model.

The study of particle momentum\nspectra requires an extension of the statistical model formalism used to handle\nparticle multiplicities, which is described in detail starting from a\nmicrocanonical treatment of single hadronising clusters. Also, a new treatment\nof extra strangeness suppression is presented which is based on the enforcement\nof fixed numbers of ssbar pairs in the primary hadrons. The considered\ncentre-of-mass energies range from ~ 10 to 30 GeV in hadronic collisions\n(pion-p, pp and Kp) and from ~ 15 to 35 GeV in e+e- collisions. The effect of\nthe decay chain following hadron generation is accurately and exhaustively\ntaken into account by a newly proposed numerical method. The exact p_T\nconservation at low energy and the increasing hard parton emission at high\nenergy bound the validity of the presently taken approach within a limited\ncentre-of-mass energy range. However, within this region, a clear consistency\nis found between the temperature parameter extracted from the present analysis\nand that obtained from fits to average hadron multiplicities in the same\ncollision systems. This finding indicates that in the hadronisation process the\nproduction of different particle species and their momentum spectra are two\nclosely related phenomena governed by one parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2001 14:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}

A quantum algorithm for Hilbert's tenth problem, which is\nequivalent to the Turing halting problem and is known to be mathematically\nnoncomputable, is proposed where quantum continuous variables and quantum\nadiabatic evolution are employed. If this algorithm could be physically\nimplemented, as much as it is valid in principle--that is, if certain\nhamiltonian and its ground state can be physically constructed according to the\nproposal--quantum computability would surpass classical computability as\ndelimited by the Church-Turing thesis. It is thus argued that computability,\nand with it the limits of Mathematics, ought to be determined not solely by\nMathematics itself but also by Physical Principles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2001 06:33:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2001 00:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2003 13:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, finite\nstatistics and the time sequential nature of real experiments still allow a\nloophole for local realism, known as the memory loophole. We show that the\nrandomized design of the Aspect experiment closes this loophole. Our main tool\nis van de Geer's (2000) supermartingale version of the classical Bernstein\n(1924) inequality guaranteeing, at the root n scale, a\nnot-heavier-than-Gaussian tail of the distribution of a sum of bounded\nsupermartingale differences. The results are used to specify a protocol for a\npublic bet between the author and L. Accardi, who in recent papers (Accardi and\nRegoli, 2000a,b, 2001; Accardi, Imafuku and Regoli, 2002) has claimed to have\nproduced a suite of computer programmes, to be run on a network of computers,\nwhich will simulate a violation of Bell's inequalites. At a sample size of\nthirty thousand, both error probabilities are guaranteed smaller than one in a\nmillion, provided we adhere to the sequential randomized design. The results\nalso show that Hess and Philipp's (2001a,b) recent claims are mistaken that\nBell's theorem fails because of time phenomena supposedly neglected by Bell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2001 09:40:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2002 16:43:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2002 13:26:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2002 13:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}

We\nindividuate the contributions of these correlations to the joint and the\nconditional probabilities of local measurements outcomes. We use these\nprobabilities to define the measure of entanglement. Our measure turns out to\nbe proportional to the so-called 2-entropy and therefore satisfies the\nproperties required for any measure of entanglement.
