Finally, we propose a special design of\nGaAs-based microcavities, which considerably weakens the bottleneck effect in\nrelaxation of excitons (polaritons) and allows us to optimize the\nacoustic-phonon-assisted thermalization processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2001 12:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

First, we define symplectic maps between\nHitchin systems related to holomorphic bundles of different degrees. We call\nthese maps the Symplectic Hecke Correspondence (SHC) of the corresponding Higgs\nbundles. They are constructed by means of the Hecke correspondence of the\nunderlying holomorphic bundles. SHC allows to construct B\\\"{a}cklund\ntransformations in the Hitchin systems defined over Riemann curves with marked\npoints. We apply the general scheme to the elliptic Calogero-Moser (CM) system\nand construct SHC to an integrable $\\SLN$ Euler-Arnold top (the elliptic\n$\\SLN$-rotator). Next, we propose a generalization of the Hitchin approach to\n2d integrable theories related to the Higgs bundles of infinite rank. The main\nexample is an integrable two-dimensional version of the two-body elliptic CM\nsystem. The previous construction allows to define SHC between the\ntwo-dimensional elliptic CM system and the Landau-Lifshitz equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2001 15:08:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2002 17:02:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2002 14:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
