Whith respect to the\nplanned imaging Cherenkov telescopes (CANGAROO III, HESS, MAGIC, VERITAS) GAW\nfollows a different approach for what concerns both the optical system and the\ndetection working mode: the Cherenkov light collector is a single acrylic flat\nFresnel lens (instead of mirrors) that allows to achieve wide field of view;\nthe photomultipliers operate in single photoelectron counting mode (instead of\ncharge integration). The single photoelectron counting mode allows to reach a\nlow energy threshold of ~200 GeV, in spite of the relatively small dimension of\nthe GAW optic system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2001 08:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The core basis\nproblem is that the robust enduring states specified by environmental\ndecoherence effects are essentially Gaussian wave packets that form continua of\nnon-orthogonal states. Hence they are not a discrete set of orthogonal basis\nstates to which finite probabilities can be assigned by the usual rules. The\nnatural way to get an orthogonal basis without going outside the Schroedinger\ndynamics is to use the eigenstates of the reduced density matrix, and this idea\nis the basis of some recent attempts by many-worlds proponents to solve the\nbasis problem. But these eigenstates do not enjoy the locality and\nquasi-classicality properties of the states defined by environmental\ndecoherence effects, and hence are not satisfactory preferred basis states. The\nbasis problem needs to be addressed and resolved before a many-worlds-type\ninterpretation can be said to exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2001 17:11:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2002 18:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
