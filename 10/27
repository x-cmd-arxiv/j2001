This\nraises the important question of what environmental effects can cause the\ntermination of star formation between z $\\approx$ 0.3 and the present. The star\nformation may be truncated due to ram-pressure stripping, or the gas in the\ndisk may be depleted by an episode of star formation caused by some external\nperturbation. To help resolve this issue, surface photometry was carried out\nfor a total of 70 early-type galaxies in the cluster Cl1358+62, at z $\\sim$\n0.33, using two-color images from the Hubble Archive. The galaxies were divided\ninto two categories based on spectroscopic criteria: 24 are type K+A (e.g.,\nstrong Balmer lines, with no visible emission lines), while the remaining 46\nare in the control sample with normal spectra. Radial color profiles were\nproduced to see if the K+A galaxies show bluer nuclei in relation to their\nsurrounding disks. Specifically, a linear gradient was fit to the radial color\nprofile of each galaxy. We find that the K+A galaxies on average tend to have\nslightly bluer gradients towards the center than the normals. A\nKolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test has been applied to the two sets of color\ngradients. The result of the test indicates that there is only a $\\sim$2%\nprobability that the K+A and normal samples are drawn from the same parent\ndistribution. There is a possible complication from a trend in the apparent\nmagnitude vs. color gradient relation, but overall our results favor the\ncentralized star formation scenario as an important process in the evolution of\ngalaxies in dense clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2001 19:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The\nassociated accretion torque could potentially counteract any gravitational-wave\ninduced spin-down, and accretion heating could affect the viscous damping rates\nand hence the instability. We discuss the effects of various external agents on\nthe r-mode instability scenario within a simple model of supernova fallback on\nto a hot young magnetized neutron star. We find that the outcome depends\nstrongly on the strength of the star's magnetic field. Our model is capable of\ngenerating spin rates for young neutron stars that accord well with initial\nspin rates inferred from pulsar observations.

This produces new subtle contributions to the\ngauge-fixing process, which eliminate all the ambiguities plaguing earlier\ngauge-fixed formulas.\n  The superstring measure can be computed explicitly and a simple expression in\nterms of modular forms is obtained. For fixed spin structure, the measure\nexhibits the expected behavior under degenerations of the surface. The measure\nallows for a unique modular covariant GSO projection. Under this GSO\nprojection, the cosmological constant, the 1-, 2- and 3- point functions of\nmassless supergravitons all vanish pointwise on moduli space without the\nappearance of boundary terms. A certain disconnected part of the 4-point\nfunction is shown to be given by a convergent, finite integral on moduli space.\nA general slice-independent formula is given for the two-loop cosmological\nconstant in compactifications with central charge c=15 and N=1 worldsheet\nsupersymmetry in terms of the data of the compactification conformal field\ntheory.\n  In this paper, a summary of the above results is presented with detailed\nconstructions, derivations and proofs to be provided in a series of subsequent\npublications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2001 18:18:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2001 19:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
