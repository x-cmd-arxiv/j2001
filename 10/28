High resolution VLA HI\nobservations show that most of the atomic gas (~90%) around NGC3077 is situated\nin a prominent tidal arm with a complex velocity structure. Little HI (~5 x\n10^7 M_sun) is associated with NGC3077 itself. High resolution OVRO\nobservations of the molecular component (CO) reveal the presence of 16\nmolecular complexes near the center of NGC3077 (total mass: ~1.6 x 10^6 M_sun).\nA virial mass analysis of the individual complexes yields a lower CO-to-H_2\nconversion factor in NGC3077 than the Galactic value - a surprising result for\na dwarf galaxy. The total (atomic and molecular) gas content in the centre of\nNGC3077 is displaced from the stellar component of NGC3077 -- this implies that\nnot only the gas at large galactocentric radii is affected by the interaction\nwithin the triplet but also the center. We speculate that the starburst\nactivity of NGC3077 was triggered by this redistribution of gas in the center.\nSome of these supershells are surrounded by neutral hydrogen. In a few cases,\nthe rims of the ionized supershells are associated with dust absorption. The\nmost prominent star forming region in NGC3077 as probed by Pa-alpha\nobservations is hidden behind a dust cloud which is traced by the molecular\ncomplexes. Correcting for extinction we derive a star forming rate of 0.05\nM_sun year^-1, i.e. given the reservoir in atomic and molecular gas in NGC3077,\nstar formation may proceed at a similar rate for a few 10^8 years. The\nefficiency to form stars out of molecular gas in NGC3077 is similar to that in\nM82.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2001 22:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Sucrose buffer decreased vesicle size and\npolydispersity and increased an X-ray contrast between phospholipid membrane\nand bulk solvent sufficiently. No influence of sucrose on the membrane\nthickness or mutual packing of hydrocarbon chains has been detected. The region\nof sucrose concentrations 30%-40% created the best experimental conditions for\nX-ray small-angle experiments with phospholipid vesicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2001 01:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
