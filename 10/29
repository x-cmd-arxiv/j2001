In the homogenizer\nthe system qubit sequentially interacts with the reservoir qubits via the\npartial swap transformation. The homogenizer realizes, in the limit sense, the\ntransformation such that at the output each qubit is in an arbitratily small\nneighbourhood of the state $\\xi$ irrespective of the initial states of the\nsystem and the reservoir qubits. This means that the system qubit undergoes an\nevolution that has a fixed point, which is the reservoir state $\\xi$. We also\nstudy approximate homogenization when the reservoir is composed of a finite set\nof identically prepared qubits. The homogenizer allows us to understand various\naspects of the dynamics of open systems interacting with environments in\nnon-equilibrium states. In particular, the reversibility vs or irreversibility\nof the dynamics of the open system is directly linked to specific (classical)\ninformation about the order in which the reservoir qubits interacted with the\nsystem qubit. This aspect of the homogenizer leads to a model of a quantum safe\nwith a classical combination.We analyze in detail how entanglement between the\nreservoir and the system is created during the process of quantum\nhomogenization. We show that the information about the initial state of the\nsystem qubit is stored in the entanglement between the homogenized qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2001 15:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The difficulties of using only the Hilbert\nspace to handle unbounded Schrodinger Hamiltonians whose spectrum has a\ncontinuous part are disclosed. Those difficulties are overcome by using an\nappropriate Rigged Hilbert Space (RHS). The RHS is able to associate an\neigenket to each energy in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, regardless of\nwhether the energy belongs to the discrete or to the continuous part of the\nspectrum. The collection of eigenkets corresponding to both discrete and\ncontinuous spectra forms a basis system that can be used to expand any physical\nwave function.
