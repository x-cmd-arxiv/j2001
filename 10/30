In addition, full account is taken of the evolutionary\nstages prior to the white dwarf formation. In particular, we follow the\nevolution of a 3 \\msun model from the zero-age main sequence (the adopted\nmetallicity is Z=0.02) all the way from the stages of hydrogen and helium\nburning in the core up to the thermally pulsing phase. After experiencing 11\nthermal pulses, the model is forced to evolve towards its white dwarf\nconfiguration by invoking strong mass loss episodes. Further evolution is\nfollowed down to the domain of the ZZ Ceti stars on the white dwarf cooling\nbranch. Emphasis is placed on the evolution of the chemical abundance\ndistribution due to diffusion processes and the role played by hydrogen burning\nduring the white dwarf evolution. Furthermore, the implications of our\nevolutionary models for the main quantities relevant for adiabatic pulsation\nanalysis are discussed.

(iii)\nThe dipole can be an ideal absolute calibrator, easily detectable in\ncosmological experiments. Following the last two objectives, the main goal of\nthe work presented here is twofold. First, we study the accuracy of the\nPlanck-HFI calibration using the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole\nmeasured by COBE as well as the Earth orbital motion dipole. We show that we\ncan reach for HFI, a relative calibration between rings of about 1% and an\nabsolute calibration better than 0.4% for the CMB channels (in the end, the\nabsolute calibration will be limited by the uncertainties on the CMB\ntemperature). We also show that Planck will be able to measure the CMB dipole\ndirection at better than 1.7 arcmin and improve on the amplitude. Second, we\ninvestigate the detection of the Cosmic Far-Infrared Background (FIRB) dipole.\nMeasuring this dipole could give a new and independent determination of the\nFIRB for which a direct determination is quite difficult due to Galactic dust\nemission contamination. We show that such a detection would require a Galactic\ndust emission removal at better than 1%, which will be very hard to achieve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2001 14:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
