An inner Lindblad-like resonance couples the\nrotating bar to orbits at all radii through the cusp, transferring the bar\npattern angular momentum to the dark matter cusp, rapidly flattening it. This\nresonance disappears for profiles with cores and is responsible for a\nqualitative difference in bar driven halo evolution with and without a cusp.\nThis bar induced evolution will have a profound effect on the structure and\nevolution of almost all galaxies. Hence, both to understand galaxy formation\nand evolution and to make predictions from theory it is necessary to resolve\nthese dynamical processes. Unfortunately, correctly resolving these important\ndynamical processes in ab initio calculations of galaxy formation is a daunting\ntask, requiring at least 4,000,000 halo particles using our SCF code, and\nprobably requiring many times more particles when using noisier tree, direct\nsummation, or grid based techniques, the usual methods employed in such\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2001 20:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We make\ndetailed comparisons of the published data with the magnetar model. The giant\nflare evolved through three stages, whose radiative mechanisms we address in\nturn. A triggering mechanism is proposed, whereby a helical distortion of the\ncore magnetic field induces large-scale fracturing in the crust and a twisting\ndeformation of the crust and exterior magnetic field. The envelope of the\npulsating tail of the August 27 flare can be accurately fit, after ~40 s, by\nthe contracting surface of a relativistically hot, but inhomogeneous, trapped\nfireball. We quantify the effects of direct neutrino-pair emission, thereby\ndeducing a lower bound ~ 10^{32} G-cm^3 to the magnetic moment of the confining\nfield. The radiative flux during the intermediate ~40 s of the burst appears to\nexceed the trapped fireball fit. The spectrum and lightcurve of this smooth\ntail are consistent with heating in an extended pair corona, possibly powered\nby continuing seismic activity in the star. We consider in detail the critical\nluminosity, below which a stable balance can be maintained between heating and\nradiative cooling in a confined, magnetized pair plasma; but above which the\nconfined plasma runs away to local thermodynamic equilibrium. In the later\npulsating tail, the best fit temperature equilibrates at a value which agrees\nwell with the regulating effect of photon splitting. The remarkable four-peaked\nsubstructure within each 5.16-s pulse provides strong evidence for the presence\nof higher magnetic multipoles in SGR 1900+14.

Ongoing debate centers on the precise radial dependence of the\nlogarithmic slope, as well as on whether it approaches a well defined\nasymptotic central value. The latest high-resolution simulations suggest that\nthe circular velocity profile is well approximated by the model proposed by\nNavarro, Frenk & White (NFW). On the other hand, the radial dependence of the\nslope of the density profile differs modestly, but significantly, from the\nmodel proposed by NFW. As a result, NFW fits tend to underestimate the density\nat radii just inside the scale radius. Rather than implying a very steep (-1.5)\ninner divergent slope, I argue that the data is actually best represented by a\nmodel where the density profile becomes increasingly shallow with radius, with\nlittle sign of approach to a well-defined asymptotic value. A model where the\n{\\it phase-space density profile} is a power law accounts well for these\nresults and suggests that the innermost slope may be as shallow as -0.75.

From new high resolution near-IR\nnarrowband images, we confirm that RNO6 hosts an embedded IR cluster that\nincludes a Herbig Be star.

RNO6NW hosts at least two IR sources and a\nbipolar molecular outflow of ~0.9 pc of length and ~0.5 solar masses.

Such OB stars are\nassociated with the double cluster h and chi Persei, and are probably members\nof the PerOB1 association. Thus star formation inside these clouds has been\nvery likely triggered by the Radiation Driven Implosion (RDI) mechanism. From\ncomparison to RDI theoretical models, we find that the similar kinematics and\nmorphology of both clouds is well explained if they are at a re-expansion\nphase. Triggered sequential star formation also explains the observed spatial\ndistribution of the members of the near-IR cluster inside the RNO6 cloud, and\nthe morphology of the H2 filament. We conclude that the RNO6 and RNO6NW clouds\nare high-mass counterparts to the cometary globules of smaller masses which\nhave been studied up to now.

We describe\nall steps of the standard reduction in detail with emphasis on the realisation\nof per pixel error propagation: Bias correction, treatment of bad pixels,\nflatfielding, and filtering of cosmic rays. The problems of conservation of PSF\n(point spread function) and error propagation in our image alignment procedure\nas well as the detection algorithm for variable sources are discussed: We build\ndifference images via image convolution with a technique called OIS (Alard &\nLupton, 1998), proceed with an automatic detection of variable sources in noise\ndominated images and finally apply a PSF-fitting, relative photometry to the\nsources found. For the WeCAPP project (Riffeser et al., 2001) we achieve 3\nsigma detections for variable sources with an apparent brightness of e.g. m =\n24.9 mag at their minimum and a variation of dm = 2.4 mag (or m = 21.9 mag\nbrightness minimum and a variation of dm = 0.6 mag) on a background signal of\n18.1 mag/arcsec^2 based on a 500 s exposure with 1.5 arcsec seeing at a 1.2 m\ntelescope. The complete per pixel error propagation allows us to give accurate\nerrors for each measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2001 15:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

First, the brane universe is\ninitially in the inflationary phase driven by the effective cosmological\nconstant induced by small mismatch between the vacuum energy in the\n5-dimensional bulk and the brane tension. This mismatch arises since the bulk\nis initially in a false vacuum. Then, the false vacuum decay occurs, nucleating\na true vacuum bubble with negative energy inside the bulk. The nucleated bubble\nexpands in the bulk and consequently hits the brane, bringing a hot big-bang\nbrane universe of the Randall-Sundrum type. Here, the termination of the\ninflationary phase is due to the change of the bulk vacuum energy. The bubble\nkinetic energy heats up the universe. As a simple realization, we propose a\nmodel, in which we assume an interaction between the brane and the bubble. We\nderive the constraints on the model parameters taking into account the\nfollowing requirements: solving the flatness problem, no force which prohibits\nthe bubble from colliding with the brane, sufficiently high reheating\ntemperature for the standard nucleosynthesis to work, and the recovery of\nNewton's law up to 1mm.

We propose a new approach for\ndefining the conformal Schwarzian derivatives. These derivatives are 1-cocycles\non the group of diffeomorphisms of $M$ related to the modules of linear\ndifferential operators. As operators, these derivatives do not depend on the\nrescaling of the metric $g.$ In particular, if the manifold $(M,g)$ is\nconformally flat, these derivatives vanish on the conformal group\n$\\Og(p+1,q+1),$ where $\\mathrm{dim} (M)=p+q.$ This work is a continuation of\n[1,4] where the Schwarzian derivative was defined on a manifold endowed with a\nprojective connection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2001 11:00:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2002 10:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
