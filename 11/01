In the magnetar model for the SGRs and AXPs,\nthese currents are maintained by magnetic stresses acting deep inside the star.\nWe construct self-similar, force-free equilibria of the current-carrying\nmagnetosphere with a power-law dependence of magnetic field on radius, B ~\nr^(-2-p), and show that a large-scale twist softens the radial dependence to p\n< 1. The spindown torque acting on the star is thereby increased in comparison\nwith a vacuum dipole. We comment on the strength of the surface magnetic field\nin the SGR and AXP sources, and the implications of this model for the narrow\nmeasured distribution of spin periods. A magnetosphere with a strong twist,\nB_\\phi/B_\\theta = O(1) at the equator, has an optical depth ~ 1 to resonant\ncyclotron scattering, independent of frequency (radius), surface magnetic field\nstrength, or charge/mass ratio of the scattering charge. When electrons and\nions supply the current, the stellar surface is also heated by the impacting\ncharges at a rate comparable to the observed X-ray output of the SGR and AXP\nsources, if B_{dipole} ~ 10^{14} G. Redistribution of the emerging X-ray flux\nat the ion and electron cyclotron resonances will significantly modify the\nemerging pulse profile and, through the Doppler effect, generate a non-thermal\ntail to the X-ray spectrum. The sudden change in the pulse profile of SGR\n1900+14 after the 27 August 1998 giant flare is related to an enhanced optical\ndepth to electron cyclotron scattering, resulting from a sudden twist imparted\nto the external magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2001 17:01:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2002 17:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-04"}

We\nthen apply PCA to these model populations. Our baseline model assumes that halo\nmass, spin parameter, and formation redshift are the governing input parameters\nand that star formation is determined by surface density through a Schmidt law.\n  In all cases, the first principal component is primarily a measure of the\nshape of the spectral energy distribution (SED), and it is usually driven by\nvariations in the spin parameter, which influences star formation through the\ndisk surface density. The second and (in some cases) third principal components\nconsist mainly of ``scale'' parameters like luminosity, disk radius, and\ncircular velocity. However, the detailed division of these scale parameters,\nthe disk surface brightness, and the rotation curve slope among the principal\ncomponents changes significantly from model to model.

Hitherto no\nconnection has been made between the time scale for divergence (denoted here by\nt_e) and the two-body relaxation time scale (t_r), even though both may be\ncalculated by consideration of two-body encounters.\n  In this paper we give a simplified model showing that divergence in phase\nspace is initially roughly exponential, on a timescale proportional to the\ncrossing time (defined as a mean time for a star to cross from one side of the\nsystem to another). In this phase t_e is much less than t_r, if N is not too\nsmall (i.e. N is much more than about 30). After several e-folding times, the\nmodel shows that the divergence slows down. Thereafter the divergence (measured\nby the energies of the bodies) varies with time as t^{1/2}, on a timescale\nnearly proportional to the familiar two-body relaxation timescale, i.e. t_e ~\nt_r in this phase. These conclusions are illustrated by numerical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2001 13:03:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2002 08:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Of course, there exist well--known methods for computing\n(co)homology groups, for example, the reduction algorithm consisting in\nreducing the matrices corresponding to the differential in each dimension to\nthe Smith normal form, from which one can read off (co)homology groups of the\ncomplex, or the incremental algorithm (due to Edelsbrunner et al.) for\ncomputing Betti numbers. However, there is a gap in the literature concerning\ngeneral methods for computing cohomology operations. For a given finite\nsimplicial complex K, we sketch a procedure including the computation of some\nprimary and secondary cohomology operations and the $A_{\\infty}$--algebra\nstructure on the cohomology of K. This method is based on the transcription of\nthe reduction algorithm mentioned above, in terms of a special type of\nalgebraic homotopy equivalences, called a contraction, of the (co)chain complex\nof K to a \"minimal\" (co)chain complex M(K). For instance, whenever the ground\nring is a field or the (co)homology of K is free, then M(K) is isomorphic to\nthe (co)homology of K. Combining this contraction with the combinatorial\nformulae for Steenrod reduced $p$th powers at cochain level developed in\n\\cite{GR99} and \\cite{Gon00}, these operations at cohomology level can be\ncomputed. Finally, a method for calculating Adem secondary cohomology\noperations $\\Phi_q: Ker(Sq^2H^q(K))\\ra H^{q+3}(K)/Sq^2H^q(K)$ is showed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2001 17:42:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-19"}

In the case of algebras with a binary operation satisfying a\nformally reducible (to be explained) identity between two n-iterates of the\noperation, it is established that the frequency of such algebras goes to zero\nas n tends to infinity. This is proved by a suitable ordering and labeling of\nthe expressions (words) of the corresponding free algebra and the formation of\na series of tableaux whose entries are the labels. The tableaux reveal\nsurprising symmetry properties, stated in terms of the Catalan numbers and\ntheir partitions. As a result of the defining identity and the tableaux all\niterates of order higher than n fall into equivalence classes of semantically\nequal ones.

Starting by an introduction to inverse problems through a few\nexamples and explaining their ill posedness nature, I briefly presented the\nmain classical deterministic methods such as data matching and classical\nregularization methods to show their limitations. I then presented the main\nclassical probabilistic methods based on likelihood, information theory and\nmaximum entropy and the Bayesian inference framework for such problems. I show\nthat the Bayesian framework, not only generalizes all these methods, but also\ngives us natural tools, for example, for inferring the uncertainty of the\ncomputed solutions, for the estimation of the hyperparameters or for handling\nmyopic or blind inversion problems.

Since its\ninterpretation as a true 'G dot per G' effect is excluded by laser and radar\nranging to the Moon and the interior planets as well as by double-pulsar\nstudies, which all put tight limits on any variation in G, this large secular\neffect appears to originate in a temporal increase of gravitational masses due\nto, e.g., capture of mass from a hypothetical cold dark matter halo of the Sun.\nBy virtue of the equivalence principle, the secular mass increase leads\nnaturally to modifications of the Newtonian dynamics in the Solar System, as it\npredicts a cosmic deceleration of moving bodies dependent upon their speed.

Based on an initial coherent state representation of\nbath oscillators and an equilibrium canonical distribution of quantum\nmechanical mean values of their co-ordinates and momenta we have derived a\n$c$-number generalized quantum Langevin equation. The approach allows us to\nimplement the method of classical non-Markovian Brownian motion to realize an\nexact generalized non-Markovian quantum Kramers' equation. The equation is\nvalid for arbitrary temperature and friction. We have solved this equation in\nthe spatial diffusion-limited regime to derive quantum Kramers' rate of barrier\ncrossing and analyze its variation as a function of temperature and friction.\nWhile almost all the earlier theories rest on quasi-probability distribution\nfunctions (like Wigner function) and path integral methods, the present work is\nbased on {\\it true probability distribution functions} and is independent of\npath integral techniques. The theory is a natural extension of the classical\ntheory to quantum domain and provides a unified description of thermal\nactivated processes and tunneling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2001 04:42:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2001 12:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
