Nevertheless, the\ndeep Subaru/IRCS J-band spectroscopic observation suggests the presence of a\nstrong broad H-alpha emission line from AXJ08494+4454. If real, the broad\nH-alpha emission line has a velocity width of 9400+-1000 km/s, which\ncorresponds to a typical broad-Balmer line velocity width of a luminous QSO.\nThe existence of the strong broad H-alpha line means that the object is not a\ntype-2 QSO, but a luminous cousin of a Seyfert 1.9 galaxy in the source-frame\noptical spectrum. The Balmer decrement of broad lines, and the broad H-alpha\nemission to the hard X-ray luminosity ratio suggest that the nucleus is\naffected by dust extinction with A_V of 1-3 mag in the optical wavelength. The\nestimated amount of dust extinction is much smaller than that expected from the\nX-ray column density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2001 00:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Due to their huge mass\n(~2x10^(-8)kg), these particles settle down to the Earth's center to form a\nkernel. Assuming the excess flux of 10-20 TW over the heat flux level produced\nby known sources, which is quoted by many researchers, to be due to the energy\nliberated in the outer kernel layers in daemon-stimulated proton decay of iron\nnuclei, we have come to the conclusion that the Earth's kernel is presently\nmeasured in few fractions of meter in size. The observed mantle flux of 3He\n(and the limiting 3He/4He ~ 10^(-4) ratio itself) can be provided if at least\none 3He(or 3T) nucleus is emitted in a daemon-stimulated decay of ~100-1000 Fe\nnuclei. This could remove actually the only objection to the hot origin of the\nEarth and to its original melting. The high energy liberation at the center of\nthe Earth drives two-phase two-dimensional convection in its inner core (IC),\nwith rolls oriented along the rotation axis. This provides an explanation for\nthe numerous features in the IC structure revealed in the recent years. The\nenergy release in the kernel grows continuously as the number of daemons in it\nincreases. Therefore the global tectonic activity, which had died out after the\ninitial differentiation and cooling off of the Earth was reanimated ~2 Gyr ago\nby the rearrangement and enhancement of convection in the mantle as a result of\nthe increasing outward energy flow. It is pointed out that as the kernel\ncontinues to grow, the tectonic activity will become intensified rather than\ndie out, as this was believed before.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2001 10:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2002 09:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

All these results are in agreement with recent experiments. By\nchoosing the initial conditions carefully, we can drive the array into any of a\nvariety of different integer SIRS's. We tentatively identify terms in the\nequations of motion which give rise to both the SIRS's and the coherence\nthreshold.

We conclude that a resonant cavity can produce threshold\nbehavior and SIRS's even in a one-dimensional array with appropriate\nexperimental parameters, and that the experimental data, including the coherent\nemission, can be understood from classical equations of motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2001 09:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
