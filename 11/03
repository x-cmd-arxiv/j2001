Both galaxies are the optically brightest galaxy of their groups.\nNGC 1199 has two companion galaxies at a median projected distance of only 33\nkpc and, based in its peculiar internal structure and large X-ray halo, NGC\n6868 has been proposed to be a merger remnant. Our analysis of $B$ and $R$\nimages uncovered a population of globular clusters around both galaxies, with\ntotal (and local) specific frequency S_N = 3.6\\pm1.8 (3.4\\pm1.5) for NGC 1199\nand S_N = 1.8\\pm1.1 (0.8\\pm0.4) for NGC 6868. The radial profile of the\nglobulars of NGC 1199 follows the light distribution of the galaxy and can be\nfitted by a power--law and a ``core model'' with a very steep slope (\\alpha =\n2.5\\pm0.3). In the case of NGC 6868, the profile of the globulars is well\nfitted by a power--law and a ``core model'' profile of slope 1.4\\pm0.3 and is\nshallower than the galaxy light distribution.

In this\npaper we consider the possibility that the OT may be a GRB afterglow. Three\nsets of images and two sets of spectra were obtained as part of the normal\noperations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In the first two image sets,\nobserved two nights apart, the object appears as a point source at\n$r^{*}\\approx 17$. The third image set, observed about 410 days later, shows an\nextended source which is more than 2.5 magnitudes fainter. The spectra were\nobserved about 400 and 670 days after the first two image sets, and both show\nan apparently normal galaxy at a redshift of 0.385. Associating the OT with the\ngalaxy, the absolute magnitude was $M_{r^*}=-24.8$, which is over 4 magnitudes\nbrighter than the most luminous supernova ever measured. The spectral energy\ndistributions of the galaxy-subtracted OT derived from the first two image sets\nare well-fit by single power-laws with indices of $\\beta_{\\nu}=-0.92$ and -1.29\nrespectively, similar to most GRB afterglows. Based upon the luminosity of the\nOT, non-detections in contemporaneous ROTSE-I images, and the change in\nspectral slope, the OT, if an afterglow, was likely discovered early during a\n``plateau'' or slowly-fading phase. The discovery of a GRB afterglow at this\nstage of the SDSS is consistent with expectations, but only if the optical\nemission is much less strongly beamed than the gamma-rays. We emphasize that\nother explanations for the OT cannot be ruled out; a recent follow-up study by\n[galyam02] provides strong evidence that this source is in fact an unusual AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2001 19:30:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2002 20:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
