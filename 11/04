Sixteen candidate clusters were\nobserved with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph on the Keck I telescope.\nAll are confirmed as bona fide GCs, although one of the clusters appears to\nhave been undergoing a transient event during our observations. In general, the\nM81 globular cluster system (GCS) is found to be very similar to the Milky Way\n(MW) and M31 systems, both chemically and kinematically. A kinematic analysis\nof the velocities of 44 M81 GCS, (the 16 presented here and 28 from previous\nwork) strongly suggests that the red, metal-rich clusters are rotating in the\nsame sense as the gas in the disk of M81. The blue, metal-poor clusters have\nhalo-like kinematics, showing no evidence for rotation. The kinematics of\nclusters whose projected galactocentric radii lie between 4 and 8 kpc suggest\nthat they are rotating much more than those which lie outside these bounds. We\nsuggest that these rotating, intermediate-distance clusters are analogous to\nthe kinematic sub-population in the metal-rich, disk GCs observed in the MW and\nwe present evidence for the existence of a similar sub-population in the\nmetal-rich clusters of M31. With one exception, all of the M81 clusters in our\nsample have ages that are consistent with MW and M31 GCs. One cluster may be as\nyoung as a few Gyrs. The correlations between absorption-line indices\nestablished for MW and M31 GCs also hold in the M81 cluster system, at least at\nthe upper end of the metallicity distribution (which our sample probes). On the\nwhole, the mean metallicity of the M81 GCS is similar to the metallicity of the\nMW and M31 GCSs. The projected mass of M81 is similar to the masses of the MW\nand M31. Its mass profile indicates the presence of a dark matter halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2001 05:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Within this approach\nthe basic algorithms are first derived up to the eighth order by direct\ndecompositions of exponential propagators and further collected using an\nadvanced composition scheme to obtain the algorithms of higher orders. Contrary\nto the scheme by Chin and Kidwell [Phys. Rev. E 62, 8746 (2000)], where\nhigh-order algorithms are introduced by standard iterations of a force-gradient\nintegrator of order four, the present method allows to reduce the total number\nof expensive force and its gradient evaluations to a minimum. At the same time,\nthe precision of the integration increases significantly, especially with\nincreasing the order of the generated schemes. The algorithms are tested in\nmolecular dynamics and celestial mechanics simulations. It is shown, in\nparticular, that the efficiency of the new fourth-order-based algorithms is\nbetter approximately in factors 5 to 1000 for orders 4 to 12, respectively. The\nresults corresponding to sixth- and eighth-order-based composition schemes are\nalso presented up to the sixteenth order.
