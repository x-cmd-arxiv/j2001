The presence of an embedded high-mass star\nstrengthens our arguments that IR-quiet cores are at an early stage of cluster\nformation.

First we demonstrate that STM predicts\nlocal and non-local high-energy corrections to general relativity in 4D, which\nare identical to those predicted by brane-world models. Secondly, we notice\nthat in brane models the usual matter in 4D is a consequence of the dependence\nof five-dimensional metrics on the extra coordinate. If the 5D bulk metric is\nindependent of the extra dimension, then the brane is void of matter. Thus, in\nbrane theory matter and geometry are unified, which is exactly the paradigm\nproposed in STM. Consequently, these two 5D theories share the same concepts\nand predict the same physics. This is important not only from a theoretical\npoint of view, but also in practice. We propose to use a combination of both\nmethods to alleviate the difficult task of finding solutions on the brane. We\nshow an explicit example that illustrate the feasibility of our proposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2001 11:05:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2001 17:31:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2001 06:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Using recent theoretical expressions to account for biases from event\nselection, results corresponding to unbiased gluon jets are extracted over a\nrange of jet energies from about 11 to 30 GeV. We find consistency between\nthese results and direct measurements of unbiased gluon jet multiplicity from\nupsilon and Z0 decays. The unbiased gluon jet data including the direct\nmeasurements are compared to corresponding results for quark jets. We perform\nfits based on analytic expressions for particle multiplicity in jets to\ndetermine the ratio r = Ng/Nq of multiplicities between gluon and quark jets as\na function of energy. We also determine the ratio of slopes, r(1) =\n(dNg/dy)/(dNq/dy), and of curvatures, r(2) = (d2Ng/dy2)/(d2Nq/dy2), where y\nspecifies the energy scale. At 30 GeV, we find r = 1.422 +/- 0.051, r(1) =\n1.761 +/- 0.071 and r(2) = 1.98 +/- 0.13, where the uncertainties are the\nstatistical and systematic terms added in quadrature. These results are in\ngeneral agreement with theoretical predictions. In addition, we use the\nmeasurements of the energy dependence of Ng and Nq to determine an effective\nvalue of the ratio of QCD color factors, CA/CF.
