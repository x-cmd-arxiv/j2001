Finally, we show that\nthe standard decomposition method used by X-ray observers to determine the mass\nflow dM/dt(r) may fail rather badly due to small deviations from perfectly\nsteady state flow. When applied to our slightly non-steady computed flows, this\ndecomposition (incorrectly) gives the usual result, dM/dt proportional to r,\nand overestimates the mass dropout dM/dt(r) at large radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2001 01:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may thus turn into a\nfactory of black holes, at which their production and evaporation may be\nstudied in detail. But even before the LHC starts operating, the Pierre Auger\nObservatory for cosmic rays, presently under construction, has an opportunity\nto search for black hole signatures. Black hole production in the scattering of\nultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos on nucleons in the atmosphere may initiate\nquasi-horizontal air showers far above the Standard Model rate. In this letter,\nwe compare the sensitivity of LHC and Auger to black hole production by\nstudying their respective reach in black hole production parameter space.\nMoreover, we present constraints in this parameter space from the\nnon-observation of horizontal showers by the Fly's Eye collaboration. We find\nthat if the ultrahigh energy neutrino flux is at the level expected from cosmic\nray interactions with the cosmic microwave background radiation, Auger has only\na small window of opportunity to detect black holes before the start of the\nLHC. If, on the other hand, larger ultrahigh energy neutrino fluxes on the\nlevel of the upper limit from ``hidden'' hadronic astrophysical sources are\nrealized in nature, then the first signs of black hole production may be\nobserved at Auger. Moreover, in this case, the Fly's Eye constraints, although\nmore model dependent, turn out to be competitive with other currently available\nconstraints on TeV-scale gravity which are mainly based on interactions\nassociated with Kaluza-Klein gravitons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2001 17:14:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2001 08:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In a class of realistic\nmodels, consistency conditions require branes and antibranes to be stuck at\ndifferent fixed points, and so their mutual attraction generates a potential\nfor one of the radii of the underlying torus or the 4D string dilaton. Assuming\nthat all other moduli have been fixed by string effects, we find that this\npotential leads naturally to a period of cosmic inflation with the radion or\ndilaton field as the inflaton. The slow-roll conditions are satisfied more\ngenerically than if the branes were free to move within the space. The\nappearance of tachyon fields at certain points in moduli space indicates the\nonset of phase transitions to different non-BPS brane systems, providing ways\nof ending inflation and reheating the corresponding observable brane universe.\nIn each case we find relations between the inflationary parameters and the\nstring scale to get the correct spectrum of density perturbations.

Many works have been done for the\nthree last steps. The first two have been neglected for a while, in part due to\nthe complexity of the problem. However, in many inverse problems, particularly\nwhen the number of data is very low, a good choice of the basis functions and a\ngood selection of the order become primary. In this paper, we first propose a\ncomplete solution within a Bayesian framework.

Our calculational method relies upon quantum\nstatistical mechanics. The Debye expansions for the Riccati-Bessel functions\nwhen carried out to a high order are found to be very useful in practice\n(thereby overflow/underflow problems are easily avoided), and also to give\naccurate results even for the lowest values of l. Another virtue of the Debye\nexpansions is that the limiting case of metals becomes quite amenable to an\nanalytical treatment in spherical geometry. We first discuss the zero-frequency\nTE mode problem from a mathematical viewpoint and then, as physical input,\ninvoke the actual dispersion relations. The result of our analysis, based upon\nadoption of the Drude dispersion relation as the most correct one at low\nfrequencies, is that the zero-frequency TE mode does not contribute for a\nmetal.
