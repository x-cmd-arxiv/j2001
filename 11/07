The underlying\ngauge symmetry is assumed to be $SU(N+1)$ with $N \\gg 1$. Appealing to a\nthermodynamical treatment, the ground-state structure of the model is\nclassically determined by a potential for the inflaton field (dynamical\nmonopole condensate) which allows for nontrivially BPS saturated and thereby\nstable solutions. For $T<M_P$ this leads to decoupling of gravity from the\ninflaton dynamics. The ground state dynamics implies a heat capacity for the\nvacuum leading to inflation for temperatures comparable to the mass scale $M$\nof the potential. The dynamics has an attractor property. In contrast to the\nusual slow-roll paradigm we have $m\\gg H$ during inflation. As a consequence,\ndensity perturbations generated from the inflaton are irrelevant for the\nformation of large-scale structure, and the model has to be supplemented with\nan inflaton independent mechanism for the generation of spatial curvature\nperturbations. Within a small fraction of the Hubble time inflation is\nterminated by a transition of the theory to its center symmetric phase.

As part of the long-term upgrade\nplan for the SRS Control System a large programme of work has been undertaken\nto modernize beamline control. This work included: development of Linux based\nPC front end computers to interface to the existing CAMAC I/O system,\nreplacement of the user interface by graphical synoptic diagrams running on\nWindows NT PCs, development of an ActiveX control for parameter display/control\nand a cache server to reduce loading on the rest of the control system. This\npaper describes the major components of the project; the techniques used to\nmanage the new PCs and discusses some of the problems encountered during\ndevelopment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2001 14:05:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2001 09:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Impossibility of\nphysical implementation of the transformation $\\varrho^{\\otimes n} \\to\n\\varrho^{n}$ in quantum mechanics is proved. For sake of further analysis the\nsimplest notion of structural completely positive approximation (SCPA) and\nstructural physical approximations (SPA) of unphysical map are introduced. Both\nalways exist for linear hermitian maps and can be optimised under natural\nassumptions. However it is shown that some intuitively natural SPA of the\nnonlinear operation $\\varrho^{\\otimes 2} \\to \\varrho^{2}$ that was already\nproven to be unphysical is impossible. It is conjectured that there exist no\nSPA of the operation $\\varrho^{\\otimes n} \\to \\varrho^{n}$ at all. It is\npointed out that, on the other hand, it is physically possible to measure the\ntrace of the second power of the state $Tr(\\varrho^{2})$ if only two copies of\nthe system are available. This gives the interpretation of one of Tsallis\nentropy as mean value of some ``multicopy'' observable. The (partial)\ngeneralisation of this idea shows that each of higher order Tsallis entropies\ncan be measured with help of only two multicopy observables. Following this\nobservations the notion of multicopy entanglement witnesses is defined and\nfirst example is provided. Finally, with help of multicopy observables simple\nmethod of spectrum state estimation is pointed out and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2001 17:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
