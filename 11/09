Expanding\npipeline structure synthesizes the advantages and traits of both parallel and\npipeline computations. In expanding pipeline computing, a novel approach\npresented in this paper, a multiplicity of processes are concurrently developed\nin parallel and knotted processor pipelines. The theoretical foundations for\nexpanding pipeline computing as a computational process are in the domains of\nalternating Turing machines, molecular computing, and E-machines. Expanding\npipeline computing constitutes the development of the conventional pipeline\narchitecture aimed at utilization of implicit parallel structures existing in\nalgorithms. Such structures appear in various kinds of visualization. Image\nderiving and processing is a field that provides diverse opportunities for\nutilization of the advantages of distributed computing. The most relevant to\nthe distributed architecture is stratified visualization with its two cases\nbased on data localization and layer separation. Visualization is treated here\nas a special case of simulation. The conceptual approach to distributed\ncomputing developed in this paper have been applied to visualization in a\ncomputer support system, which is utilized in radiology and namely, for the\nnoninvasive treatment of brain aneurysms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2001 00:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To cope with the\nincrease of loads on the network due to faster data acquisition and the\naddition of equipment data, networking hardware has been installed in the last\nfew years. The upgraded network replaces the original FDDI backbone and\nswitches with mixed FDDI/gigabit ethernet and Layer-3 switches. It is necessary\nto keep the double ring topology for the FDDI and introduce link aggregation\ntechnology for the gigabit ethernet to maintain the full redundancy and\nbandwidth of the system. This paper will discuss the network performance of the\ngigabit ethernet including its latency and redundancy. We also discuss a future\nplan for the network including Quality-of-Service over the gigabit ethernet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2001 11:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
