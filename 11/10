However, we know of only\na dozen dwarf satellites close to this mass. Are these lumps simply lacking in\nstars or is there a fundamental flaw in our most popular cosmology? By studying\nthe tidal debris of known satellites we can potentially address this question.\nIn this paper, we quantify the the effects of the dark matter lumps on tidal\ntails. The lumps scatter stars in the tidal tails from their original orbits\nproducing a distinctive signature. We simulate debris evolution in smooth and\nlumpy halos potentials and use our simulations to motivate and test a\nstatistical measure of the degree of scattering apparent in the angular\nposition and radial velocity measurement of debris stars - the ``scattering\nindex''. We find that the scattering index can in general distinguish between\nthe levels of substructure predicted by CDM cosmologies and smooth Milky Way\nmodels, but that the sensitivity of the debris depends on the orientation of\nthe parent satellite's orbit relative to the largest lumps orbits.\n  We apply our results to the carbon star stream associated with the\nSagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) and find that these stars appear to be more\nscattered than we expect for debris orbiting in a smooth halo. However, the\ndegree of scattering is entirely consistent with that expected due to the\ninfluence of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is on an orbit that intersects\nSgr's own. We conclude that the current data is unable to constrain CDM models.\nNevertheless, our study suggests that future data sets of debris stars\nassociated with other Milky Way satellites could provide strong constraints on\nCDM models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2001 19:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

When the cooling timescale is smaller than the\ndynamical timescale, gamma can be evaluated from the derivatives of cooling and\nheating functions, using the condition of thermal equilibrium. We present\ncalculations of gamma for protogalaxies in which the metal abundance is so\nsmall that H_2 and HD cooling dominates.

At low\ntemperatures the density probability distribution should fall ra pidly for\ndensities larger than this value, which corresponds physically to the critical\ndensity at which collisional and radiative deexcitation rate s of HD are equal.\nThe densities attained in turbulent protogalaxies thus depend on the relatively\nlarge deuterium abundance in our universe.

In anomalous coarsening, the typical domain size of an ordered phase\ngrows more slowly with time than the power law dependence that is usually\nobserved, for example, in magnetic systems. We discuss how anomlaous coarsening\nmay arise through domain-size dependent energy barriers in the coarsening\nprocess. We also review the phenomenology of glassy dynamics and discuss how\nsimple nonequilibrium models may be used to reproduce certain aspects of the\nphenomenology. In particular, models involving dynamical constraints that give\nrise to anomalous coarsening are considered. Two models, the Asymmetric\nConstrained Ising Chain and the ABC model, are discussed in detail with\nemphasis on how the large energy barriers to coarsening arise through the local\ndynamical constraints. Finally, the relevance of models exhibiting anomalous\ncoarsening to glassy systems is discussed in a wider context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2001 16:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The\npower of UML lies in Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools such as\nRational Rose, which are also capable of generating software structures from\nvisual object definitions and relations. UML also allows add-ons that define\nspecific structures and patterns in order to steer and automate the design\nprocess. We have developed an add-on called Control System Modeling Language\n(CSML). It introduces entities and relationships that we know from control\nsystems, such as \"property\" representing a single controllable point/channel,\nor an \"event\" specifying that a device is capable of notifying its clients\nthrough events. Entities can also possess CSML-specific characteristics, such\nas physical units and valid ranges for input parameters. CSML is independent of\nany specific language or technology and generic such that any control system\ncan be described with it. Simple transformation scripts map CSML defined\nstructures to APIs and tools such as EPICS, CDEV, SCADA, Abeans, BACI and\ngenerate the appropriate database or source files. Advantages of control system\ndevelopment with CSML are discussed on a concrete example of a bending magnet's\npower supply in a synchrotron accelerator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2001 17:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To date, most TINE-based client-side applications\nhave been written using ACOP [3] (a narrow-interface accelerator component) in\nVisual Basic (VB), which has provided a remarkably powerful developing\nenvironment for generating professional control applications. Currently,\nhowever, VB control applications can only run on Windows-based desktop machines\nand consoles. As it is often desirable to provide certain control applications\non non-Windows platforms (or indeed over the Web), we have created an equally\npowerful developing environment based on Java and the next release of Abeans,\nwhere an ACOP-like narrow-interface bean has been developed. Like ACOP, the\nAbean itself accepts plugs from various communication protocols, but was\nbrought to fruition at DESY using the TINE Java class. Details concerning\nmatching Abeans and TINE, as well as the pros and cons of wide versus narrow\ninterfaces will be presented below. Several applications will also presented\nalong with the results of benchmarking against similar VB applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2001 21:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In its early life, the laser\nwas associated with the physics of electron volts and of the chemical bond.\nOver the past fifteen years, however, we have seen a surge in our ability to\nproduce high intensities, five to six orders of magnitude higher than was\npossible before. At these intensities, particles, electrons and protons,\nacquire kinetic energy in the mega-electron-volt range through interaction with\nintense laser fields. This opens a new age for the laser, the age of nonlinear\nrelativistic optics coupling even with nuclear physics. We suggest a path to\nreach an extremely high-intensity level $10^{26-28} $W/cm$^2$ in the coming\ndecade, much beyond the current and near future intensity regime $10^{23}\n$W/cm$^2$, taking advantage of the megajoule laser facilities. Such a laser at\nextreme high intensity could accelerate particles to frontiers of high energy,\ntera-electron-volt and peta-electron-volt, and would become a tool of\nfundamental physics encompassing particle physics, gravitational physics,\nnonlinear field theory, ultrahigh-pressure physics, astrophysics, and\ncosmology.

The principal ingredient is the\nLagrangian of the system which we derive correct to the first order in the\natomic centre of mass velocity. For the first time using centre of mass\ncoordinates, a gauge transformation is performed and relevant relativistic\ncorrections are included. The Lagrangian is symmetric in the electric and\nmagnetic aspects of the problem and includes two key interaction terms, namely\nthe Aharanov-Casher and the Roentgen interaction terms. The constitutive\nrelations, which link the electromagnetic fields to the matter fields via their\nelectric polarisation and magnetisation, follow from the Lagrangian as well as\nthe corresponding Hamiltonian.
