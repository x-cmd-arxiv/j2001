For example,\nthe measurement and interpretation of the basic parameters of the electroweak\ntheory and CP violation depends on an understanding of the dynamics and phase\nstructure of exclusive B-meson decay amplitudes. In this review, I discuss a\nnumber of ways in which the required hadron wavefunctions can be measured (such\nas two-photon reactions and diffractive dissociation) or calculated from first\nprinciples. An important tool for describing relativistic composite systems in\nquantum field theory is the light-front Fock expansion, which encodes the\nproperties of a hadrons in terms of a set of frame-independent n-particle\nwavefunctions. Evolution in light-cone time allows the construction of an\n\"event amplitude generator\" in which only non-ghost physical degrees of freedom\nand integration over physical phase appear. The diffractive dissociation of a\nhadron at high energies, by either Coulomb or Pomeron exchange, has a natural\ndescription in QCD as the materialization of the projectile's light-cone\nwavefunctions; in particular, the diffractive dissociation of a meson, baryon,\nor photon into high transverse momentum jets measures the shape and other\nfeatures of the projectile's distribution amplitude. I also review recent work\nwhich shows that the structure functions measured in deep inelastic lepton\nscattering are affected by final-state rescattering, thus modifying their\nconnection with the light-cone probability distributions. In particular, the\nshadowing of nuclear structure functions is due to destructive interference\neffects from leading-twist diffraction of the virtual photon, physics not\nincluded in the nuclear light-cone wavefunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2001 23:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-11"}

Each participating\nlab is responsible for a different section of the machine: LBNL for the\nFront-End section, LANL for the warm LINAC section, TJNAF for the cold LINAC\nsection and BNL for the Ring and transfer line sections. The vacuum\ninstrumentation and control systems are scheduled to be installed and be in\noperation at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2004 or 2005. Although the\nrequirements vary for different sections of the machine, a collaborative effort\nhas been made to standardize vacuum instrumentation components and the global\ncontrol system interfaces. This paper summarizes the design of each sub-section\nof vacuum instrumentation and control system and discusses SNS standards for\nIon Pump and Gauge controllers, Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) interfaces,\nLadder Logic programming and the SNS global control system interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2001 19:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
