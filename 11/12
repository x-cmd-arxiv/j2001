It implies for\nexample the field equations, energy-momentum, charge- and ghost-number\nconservation, renormalized equal-time commutation relations and BRST-symmetry.\n  It seems that the master Ward identity can nearly always be satisfied, the\nonly exceptions we know are the usual anomalies. We prove the compatibility of\nthe master Ward identity with the other (re)normalization conditions of causal\nperturbation theory, and for pure massive theories we show that the 'central\nsolution' of Epstein and Glaser fulfills the master Ward identity, if the\nUV-scaling behavior of its individual terms is not relatively lowered.\n  Application of the master Ward identity to the BRST-current of non-Abelian\ngauge theories generates an identity (called 'master BRST-identity') which\ncontains the information which is needed for a local construction of the\nalgebra of observables, i.e. the elimination of the unphysical fields and the\nconstruction of physical states in the presence of an adiabatically switched\noff interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2001 09:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2002 14:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The capacity to generate entangled states is one of the basic\nrequirements for building quantum computers. Hence, efficient experimental\nmethods for detection, verification and estimation of quantum entanglement are\nof great practical importance. Here, we propose an experimentally viable,\n\\emph{direct} detection of quantum entanglement which is efficient and does not\nrequire any \\emph{a priori} knowledge about the quantum state. In a particular\ncase of two entangled qubits it provides an estimation of the amount of\nentanglement. We view this method as a new form of quantum computation, namely,\nas a decision problem with quantum data structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2001 19:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
