Such jets (or CFWs) are supposedly formed when a compact companion, a\nmain sequence star or a white dwarf, accretes mass from the AGB star, forms an\naccretion disk, and blows two jets. This type of flow, which is thought to\nshape bipolar planetary nebulae (PNe), requires 3-dimensional gas dynamical\nsimulations, which are limited in the parameter space they can cover. By\nimposing several simplifying assumptions, I derive simple expressions which\nreproduce some basic properties of lobes in bipolar PNe, and which can be used\nto guide future numerical simulations.

I show that the jet interaction with the slow wind can form\nlobes which are narrow close to, and far away from, the central binary system,\nand which are wider somewhere in between. Jets that are recollimated and have\nconstant cross section can form cylindrical lobes with constant diameter, as\nobserved in several bipolar PNe. Close to their source, jets blown by main\nsequence companions are radiative; only further out they become adiabatic,\ni.e., they form high-temperature low-density bubbles that inflate the lobes.\nThis implies that radiative cooling must be incorporated in numerical codes\nintended to study the formation of lobes in PNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2001 03:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It has not to be valid for alternative geometrical\nstructures. A teleparallel manifold is defined as a parallelizable\ndifferentiable 4D-manifold endowed with a class of smooth coframe fields\nrelated by global Lorentz, i.e., SO(1,3) transformations. In this article a\ngeneral free parametric class of teleparallel models is considered. It includes\na 1-parameter subclass of viable models with the Schwarzschild coframe\nsolution. A new form of the coframe field equation is derived from the general\nteleparallel Lagrangian by introducing the notion of a 3-parameter conjugate\nfield strength $\\F^a$. The field equation turns out to have a form completely\nsimilar to the Maxwell field equation $d*\\F^a=\\T^a$. By applying the Noether\nprocedure, the source 3-form $\\T^a$ is shown to be connected with the\ndiffeomorphism invariance of the Lagrangian. Thus the source $\\T^a$ of the\ncoframe field is interpreted as the total conserved energy-momentum current.\nThe energy-momentum tensor for coframe is defined. The total energy-momentum\ncurrent of a system of a coframe and a material fields is conserved. Thus a\nredistribution of the energy-momentum current between a material and a coframe\n(gravity) fields is possible in principle, unlike as in the standard GR. For\nspecial values of parameters, when the GR is reinstated, the energy-momentum\ntensor gives up the invariant sense, i.e., becomes a pseudo-tensor.

Topological methods provide the\nmeans for the detection of gross features, such as holes in a manifold, and\ntherefore one would clearly anticipate that the defects, if identifiable by\nsuch means, to be linked with that kind of configurations. In physical media,\nhowever, defects usually manifest themselves in ways which have no distinct and\ndirect association with patterns of topological value along the lines of our\nprevious reference. In this paper we will postulate that the defects do not\nthemselves correspond to topological features. Instead, they are forced to\nexist in order to redress the violation of physical rules happening as a result\nof the topological nature of our system. We will, thus, assume that the\ntopology of our system changes with the introduction of defects. Therefore, the\nrelevent to our study topological methods will be applied to a well defined\nphysical system only in the absence of defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2001 12:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A typical situation occurs when one knows that a\nmultilinear operator satisfies a weak $L^q$ estimate for a single index $q$\n(which may be less than one) and that all the adjoints of the multilinear\noperator are of similar nature, and thus they also satisfy the same weak $L^q$\nestimate. Under this assumption, in this expository note we give a general\nmultilinear interpolation theorem which allows one to obtain strong type\nboundedness for the operator (and all of its adjoints) for a large set of\nexponents. The key point in the applications we discuss is that the\ninterpolation theorem can handle the case $q \\leq 1$. When $q > 1$, weak $L^q$\nhas a predual, and such strong type boundedness can be easily obtained by\nduality and multilinear interpolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2001 23:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The emphasis is on the\nconsistent treatment of the off-shell motion between collisions and on the\nnon-instant and non-local picture of binary collisions. The resulting kinetic\nequation is of the Boltzmann type, and it represents an interpolation between\nthe theory of transport in metals and the theory of moderately dense gases. The\nfree motion of particles is renormalised by various mean field and mass\ncorrections in the spirit of Landau's quasiparticles in metals. The collisions\nare non-local in the spirit of Enskog's theory of non-ideal gases. The\ncollisions are moreover non-instant, a feature which is absent in the theory of\ngases, but which is shown to be important for dense Fermi systems. In spite of\nits formal complexity, the presented theory has a simple implementation within\nthe Monte-Carlo simulation schemes. Applications in nuclear physics are given\nfor heavy-ion reactions and the results are compared with the former theory and\nrecent experimental data. The effect of the off-shell motion and the non-local\nand non-instant collisions on the dynamics of the system can be characterised\nin terms of thermodynamic functions such as the energy density or the pressure\ntensor. Non-equilibrium counterparts of these functions and the corresponding\nbalance equations are derived and discussed from two points of view. Firstly,\nthey are used to prove the conservation laws. Secondly, the role of individual\nmicroscopic mechanisms in fluxes of particles and momenta and in\ntransformations of the energy is clarified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2001 07:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Holonomies are the generalization of the Berry phases to unitary\nmatrices with dimensionality the same as the degree of degeneracy of the\nsystem. In a nonlinear Kerr medium the degenerate states of laser beams are\ninterpreted as qubits. Control manipulations with displacers, squeezers and\ntwo-mode interfering devices performed in a cyclic, adiabatic fashion produce\nholonomies. Here, they are employed as logical gates for our HQC proposal. The\neffects of errors from imperfect control of classical parameters, the looping\nvariation of which builds up holonomic gates, are investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2001 15:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
