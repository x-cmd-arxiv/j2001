This galaxy is\nparticularly interesting because its young stellar population is extremely\nsimilar to that of the well-studied type iE Blue Compact Dwarf VII Zw 403,\ndespite its different spatial morphology and old stellar content. Our Hubble\nSpace Telescope/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 single-star photometry for UGCA\n290 extends over nine magnitudes in I, and allows a detailed study of its star\nformation history. Using synthetic color-magnitude diagrams, we show that the\nrecent \"burst\" which gives this galaxy its BCD status is a moderate enhancement\nin star formation which lasted for approximately 20 Myr, at a rate about ten\ntimes above its previous rate. The star formation history for most of the\nprevious billion years is consistent with a constant rate, although\nenhancements as large as the current one are possible at times ealier than 400\nMyr ago. We estimate that the total mass converted into stars in UGCA 290 more\nthan one billion years ago is about three times the astrated mass since that\ntime. The initial mass function is consistent with a Salpeter slope, and the\nstellar metallicity is bracketed by Z_sun/50 and Z_sun/5, with evidence for\nmetallicity evolution. Similar results for the star formation history over the\npast 600 Myr apply to VII Zw 403. Our main result is that despite the\ntraditional picture of BCDs, the current bursts in these two galaxies are\nneither remarkably intense nor short-lived, and that most of their star\nformation occured more than a billion years ago.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2001 16:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Using the\nobserved long term light curve of SS Cyg and d=166 pc, we obtain for the mean\nmass transfer rate 4.2*10^(17)g/s. In addition, we calculate the vertical\nstructure of the accretion disc taking into account heating of the outer disc\nby the stream impact. Comparing the mean accretion rate derived from the\nobservations with the calculated critical mass transfer rate, we find that the\ndisc instability model disagrees with the observed long term light curve of SS\nCyg as the mean mass transfer rate is greater or similar to the critical mass\ntransfer rate. The failure of the model indicated by this result can be\nconfirmed by considering that the accretion rate at the onset of the decline\nshould be exactly equal to the value critical for stability. In contrast to\nthis prediction of the model, we find that the accretion rate required to\nexplain the observed visual magnitude at the onset of the decline must be\nsignificantly higher than the critical mass transfer rate. Our results strongly\nsuggest that either the usually assumed temperature dependence of the viscosity\nparameter alpha is not a realistic description of the disc viscosity, that the\nmass transfer rate in SS Cyg noticeably increases during the outbursts or,\nfinally, that the HST distance of 166 pc, is too high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2001 12:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In many applications such as non-destructive\ntesting, we look for a fault region (air) in a homogeneous, known background\n(metal). The image reconstruction problem then becomes the determination of the\nshape of the default region. Two approaches can be used: modeling the image as\na binary Markov random field and estimating the pixels of the image, or\nmodeling the shape of the fault and estimating it directly from the\nprojections. In this work we model the fault shape by a deformable polygonal\ndisc or a deformable polyhedral volume and propose a new method for directly\nestimating the coordinates of its vertices from a very limited number of its\nprojections. The basic idea is not new, but in other competing methods, in\ngeneral, the fault shape is modeled by a small number of parameters (polygonal\nshapes with very small number of vertices, snakes and deformable templates) and\nthese parameters are estimated either by least squares or by maximum likelihood\nmethods. We propose modeling the shape of the fault region by a polygon with a\nlarge number of vertices, allowing modeling of nearly any shape and estimation\nof its vertices' coordinates directly from the projections by defining the\nsolution as the minimizer of an appropriate regularized criterion. This\nformulation can also be interpreted as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate in\na Bayesian estimation framework. To optimize this criterion we use either a\nsimulated annealing or a special purpose deterministic algorithm based on\niterated conditional modes (ICM).

In particular: The action of\nthe Sasaki hook $(a\\stackrel{S}{\\to}-)$ for fixed antecedent $a$ assigns to\nsome property ``the weakest cause before the measurement of actuality of that\nproperty after the measurement'', i.e. ${(a\\stackrel{S}{\\to}b)}$ is the weakest\nproperty that guarantees actuality of $b$ after performing the measurement\nrepresented by the projector that has the `subspace $a$' as eigenstates for\neigenvalue 1, say, the measurement that `tests' $a$ .
