This mechanism requires very high stellar densities, up to\n4 orders of magnitude higher than are observed in the cores of dense young\nclusters. In this model, the required stellar densities arise due to gas\naccretion onto stars in the cluster core, including the precursers of the\nmassive stars. This forces the core to contract until the stellar densities are\nsufficiently high for collisions to occur. Gas accretion is also likely to play\na major role in determining the distribution of stellar masses in the cluster\nas well as the observed mass segregation. One of the main advantages of this\nmechanism is that it explicitly relies on the cluster environment in order to\nproduce the massive stars. It is thus in a position to explain the relation\nbetween clustered and massive star formation which is not an obvious outcome of\nan isolated accretion mechanism.

We present simulated spectral\nenergy distributions and colors over a wide range of masses. The SED is most\nsensitive to disk mass in the far-IR and longer wavelengths, which is already\nknown from millimeter and radio observations.

Our sample\nconsists of 705 galaxies with measurements of the fluxes and equivalent widths\nof Halpha, [OII], and one or both of [NII] and [SII]. For a subset of the\ngalaxies, 60 and 100 micron IRAS fluxes are available. We compare the star\nformation rates derived using the models with those derived using standard\nestimators based on the Halpha, the [OII] and the far-infrared luminosities of\nthe galaxies. The CL01 SFR estimates agree well with those derived from the\nIRAS fluxes, but are typically a factor of ~3 higher than those derived from\nthe Halpha or the [OII] fluxes, even after the usual mean attenuation\ncorrection of A_Halpha=1 mag is applied to the data. We show that the reason\nfor this discrepancy is that the standard Halpha estimator neglects the\nabsorption of ionizing photons by dust in HII regions and the contamination of\nHalpha emission by stellar absorption. We also use our sample to study\nvariations in star formation and metallicity as a function of galaxy absolute\nbJ magnitude. For this sample, the star formation rate per unit bJ luminosity\nis independent of magnitude. The gas-phase oxygen abundance does increase with\nbJ luminosity, although the scatter in metallicity at fixed magnitude is large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2001 23:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Development of synchrotron light sources has changed the situation; by\nthe resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) technique the orbital ordering has\nsuccessfully been observed . In this article, we review progress in the recent\nstudies of RXS in manganites. We start with a detailed review of the RXS\nexperiments applied to the orbital ordered manganites and other correlated\nelectron systems. We derive the scattering cross section of RXS where the\ntensor character of the atomic scattering factor (ASF) with respect to the\nx-ray polarization is stressed. Microscopic mechanisms of the anisotropic\ntensor character of ASF is introduced and numerical results of ASF and the\nscattering intensity are presented. The azimuthal angle scan is a unique\nexperimental method to identify RXS from the orbital degree of freedom. A\ntheory of the azimuthal angle and polarization dependence of the RXS intensity\nis presented. The theoretical results show good agreement with the experiments\nin manganites. Apart from the microscopic description of ASF, a theoretical\nframework of RXS to relate directly to the 3d orbital is presented. The\nscattering cross section is represented by the correlation function of the\npseudo-spin operator for the orbital degree of freedom. A theory is extended to\nthe resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and methods to observe excitations of\nthe orbital degree of freedom are proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2001 04:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The propagation is due to the interplay of band-to-band tunneling\nand impact ionization. Our numerical simulations show that the front can be\ntriggered when an extremely sharp voltage ramp ($\\sim 10 {\\rm kV/ns}$) is\napplied in reverse direction to a Si $p^+-n-n^+-$structure that is connected in\nseries with an external load. The triggering occurs after a delay of 0.7 to 0.8\nns. The maximal electrical field at the front edge exceeds $10^6 {\\rm V/cm}$.\nThe front velocity $v_f$ is 40 times faster than the saturated drift velocity\n$v_s$. The front passes through the $n-$base with a thickness of $100 {\\mu m}$\nwithin approximately 30 ps, filling it with dense electron-hole plasma. This\npassage is accompanied by a voltage drop from 8 kV to dozens of volts. In this\nway a voltage pulse with a ramp up to $500 {\\rm kV/ns}$ can be applied to the\nload. The possibility to form a kilovolt pulse with such a voltage rise rate\nsets new frontiers in pulse power electronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2001 12:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Later, using spinorial representations of surfaces, the\nsame flows were interpreted as deformations of surfaces in 3- and 4-space\npreserving the Willmore energy. This last property suggest that the correct\ngeometric setting for this theory is Moebius invariant surface geometry. We\ndevelop this view point in the first part of the paper where we derive the\nfundamental invariants -- the Schwarzian derivative, the Hopf differential and\na normal connection -- of a conformal immersion into n-space together with\ntheir integrability equations.

The present work is a continuation of an earlier paper [E. Almaas\nand I. Brevik, J. Opt. Soc. Am. B {\\bf 12}, 2429 (1995)], in which both the\nhorizontal and the vertical radiation forces were calculated with the\nconstraint that the sphere was nonabsorbing. Whereas the horizontal force can\nbe well accounted for within this constraint, there is no possibility to\ndescribe the {\\it repulsiveness} of the vertical force, so distinctly\ndemonstrated in the Kawata-Sugiura experiment [Opt. Lett. {\\bf 17}, 772\n(1992)], unless a departure from the theory of pure nondispersive dielectrics\nis made in some way. Introduction of absorption, i.e. a complex refractive\nindex, is one natural way of generalizing the previous theory. We work out\ngeneral expressions for the vertical force for this case and illustrate the\ncalculations by numerical computations. It turns out that, when applied to the\nKawata-Sugiura case, the repulsive radiation force caused by absorption is {\\it\nnot} strong enough to account for the actual lifting of the polystyrene latex\nor glass spheres. The physical reason for the experimental outcome is, in this\ncase, most probably the presence of surfactants making the surface of the\nspheres partially conducting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2001 12:13:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2003 22:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
