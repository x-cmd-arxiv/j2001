The hotspot is probably the source of seed photons for\nComptonization. The hard component illuminates the disc, giving rise to a\nreflected spectrum. The inferred evolution of the inner radius is not\nconsistent with the magnetic field truncating the disc. Instead it seems more\nlikely that the inner disc radius is set by some much longer time-scale\nprocess, most probably connected to the overall evolution of the accretion\ndisc. This disc truncation mechanism would then have to be generic in all low\nmass accretion rate flows both in disc accreting neutron stars and black hole\nsystems.

Three of the twelve\nsources, TVLM513-46546, 2MASS J0036159+182110, and BRI0021-0214, were observed\nto flare and also exhibit persistent emission, indicating that magnetic\nactivity is not quenched at the bottom of the main sequence.

HNC 1-0 is\ndetected in 9, CN 1-0 is detected in 10 and CN 2-1 in 7 of the galaxies. We\nalso report the first detection of HC3N (10-9) emission in Arp220. The\nexcitation of HNC and CN emission requires densities n > 10E4 cm-3. We compare\ntheir intensities to that of the usual high density tracer HCN. The\nI(HCN)/I(HNC}) and I(HCN)/I(CN) 1-0 line intensity ratios vary significantly,\nfrom 0.5 to >6, among the galaxies. This implies that the actual properties of\nthe dense gas is varying among galaxies who otherwise have similar I(CO)/I(HCN)\nline intensity ratios. We suggest that the HNC emission is not a reliable\ntracer of cold (10 K) gas at the center of LIRGs, as it often is in the disk of\nthe Milky Way. Instead, the HNC abundance may remain substantial, despite high\ngas temperatures, because the emission is emerging from regions where the HCN\nand HNC formation and destruction processes are dominated by ion-neutral\nreactions which are not strongly dependent on kinetic temperature. We find five\ngalaxies (four AGNs and one starburst) where the I(HCN)/I(HNC) intensity ratio\nis close to unity. In other AGNs, however, I(HCN)/I(HNC}) is >4. The CN\nemission is on average a factor of two fainter than HCN, but the variation is\nlarge and there seems to be a trend of reduced relative CN luminosity with\nincreasing IR luminosity. One galaxy, NGC3690, has a CN luminosity twice that\nof HCN and its ISM is thus strongly affected by UV radiation. We discuss the\nI(HCN)/I(HNC) and I(HCN)/I(CN) line ratios as indicators of starburst\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2001 10:18:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

I explore the fractal geometry of the resulting spacetime, using\ncoordinate-independent quantities. The formalism of stochastic inflation can be\nused to obtain the fractal dimension of the set of eternally inflating points\n(the ``eternal fractal''). I also derive a nonlinear branching diffusion\nequation describing global properties of the eternal set and the probability to\nrealize eternal inflation. I show gauge invariance of the condition for\npresence of eternal inflation. Finally, I consider the question of whether all\nthermalized regions merge into one connected domain. Fractal dimension of the\neternal set provides a (weak) sufficient condition for merging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2001 20:50:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2002 18:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

The model describes two cells (a \"donor\" and \"sensor\")\nwhose intracellular dynamics involve a calcium-induced, calcium release\nprocess. The cells are coupled by assuming that the the input of the sensor\ncell is proportional to the output of the donor cell. As one varies the\nfrequency of calcium oscillations of the donor cell, the sensor cell passes\nthrough a sequence of N:M phase locked regimes and exhibits a \"Devil's\nstaircase\" behavior. Such a phase locked response has been seen experimentally\nin pulsatile stimulation of single cells. We also study a stochastic version of\nthe coupled two cell model. We find that phase locking holds for realistic\nchoices for the cell volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2001 22:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The theory\nprovided by Ida [Phys. Lett.

Namely, two of the three transition frequencies correspond to the\nnatural frequencies, while the remaining does not. In a subsequent paper [M.\nIda, Phys. Rev. E 67 (2003) 056617], it was shown theoretically that transition\nfrequencies other than the natural frequencies may cause the sign reversal of\nthe secondary Bjerknes force acting between pulsating bubbles. In the present\nstudy, we employ a direct numerical simulation technique that uses the\ncompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a surface-tension term as the\ngoverning equations to investigate the transition frequencies of two coupled\nbubbles by observing their pulsation amplitudes and directions of translational\nmotion, both of which change as the driving frequency changes. The numerical\nresults reproduce the recent theoretical predictions, validating the existence\nof the transition frequencies not corresponding to the natural frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2001 06:19:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2002 09:02:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2004 02:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper we present an improvement to the Abel inversion\ntechnique in which the axial symmetry condition is relaxed by means of a\ntruncated Legendre Polinomial expansion in the azimutal angle.
