The beam\ndiagnostics tool described in this paper provides the data about position and\ndimensions of e-/e+ beams from CCD matrix controller via 100-Mbit Ethernet. The\nnext tool provides measuring of beam energy at the VEPP-4M collider using a\nwell-known method of resonance depolarization by the observation of the\npolarization degree on the effect of internal scattering of particles. Data\nvisualization tools are based on CERN ROOT framework.
