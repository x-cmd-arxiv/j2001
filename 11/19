A small or no detectable flux does not by itself imply the\nintergalactic medium (IGM) is neutral. Inferring the average neutral fraction\nfrom the observed absorption requires assumptions about clustering of the IGM,\nwhich the gravitational instability model supplies. Our most stringent\nconstraint on the neutral fraction at z ~ 6 is derived from the mean Lyman-beta\ntransmission measured from the z=6.28 SDSS quasar of Becker et al. -- the\nneutral hydrogen fraction at mean density has to be larger than 4.7 times\n10^{-4}. This is substantially higher than the neutral fraction of ~ 3-5 times\n10^{-5} at z = 4.5 - 5.7, suggesting that dramatic changes take place around or\njust before z ~ 6, even though current constraints are still consistent with a\nfairly ionized IGM at z ~ 6. An interesting alternative method to constrain the\nneutral fraction is to consider the probability of having many consecutive\npixels with little flux, which is small unless the neutral fraction is high.\nThis constraint is slightly weaker than the one obtained from the mean\ntransmission. We show that while the derived neutral fraction at a given\nredshift is sensitive to the power spectrum normalization, the size of the jump\naround z ~ 6 is not. We caution that systematic uncertainties include spatial\nfluctuations in the ionizing background, and the continuum placement. Tests are\nproposed. In particular, the sightline to sightline dispersion in mean\ntransmission might provide a useful diagnostic. We express the dispersion in\nterms of the transmission power spectrum, and develop a method to calculate the\ndispersion for spectra that are longer than the typical simulation box.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Nov 2001 21:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2001 16:41:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Jul 2002 18:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is shown that in the limit of complete dipole\nblocking, the system is isomorphic to a multimode Jaynes-Cummings model. While\ndark-state population transfer is not capable of creating entanglement, other\nadiabatic processes are identified that lead to complex, maximally entangled\nstates, such as the N-particle analog of the GHZ state in a few steps. The\nprocess is robust, works for even and odd particle numbers and the\ncharacteristic time for entanglement generation scales with N^a, with a being\nless than unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2001 15:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
