At an age of $10^4$ yr, the reverse shock front is expected to\nhave moved back to the center of the remnant. Ejecta clumps with an initial\ndensity contrast $\\chi \\sim 100$ relative to their surroundings are found to be\nrapidly fragmented and decelerated. In order to cause a pronounced protrusion\non the blast wave, as observed in the Vela remnant, $\\chi \\sim 1000$ may be\nrequired.

We assume that the stellar encounter increases planetesimal\nvelocities to the shattering velocity, initiating a collisional cascade in the\ndisk.

In this paper, we investigate the operator\namenability of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra B(G) and of the reduced\nFourier-Stieltjes algebra B_r(G). The natural conjecture is that any of these\nalgebras is operator amenable if and only if G is compact. We partially prove\nthis conjecture with mere operator amenability replaced by operator\nC-amenability for some constant C < 5. In the process, we obtain a new\ndecomposition of B(G), which can be interpreted as the non-commutative\ncounterpart of the decomposition of M(G) into the discrete and the continuous\nmeasures. We further introduce a variant of operator amenability - called\noperator Connes-amenability - which also takes the dual space structure on B(G)\nand B_r(G) into account. We show that B_r(G) is operator Connes-amenable if and\nonly if G is amenable.

By analogy with the Fasshauer's Hermite interpolation, we\nrecently developed the symmetric BKM and boundary particle methods (BPM), where\nthe latter is based on the multiple reciprocity principle. The resulting\ninterpolation matrix of them is always symmetric irrespective of boundary\ngeometry and conditions. Furthermore, the proposed direct BKM and BPM apply the\npractical physical variables rather than expansion coefficients and become very\ncompetitive alternative to the boundary element method. On the other hand, by\nusing the Green integral we derive a new domain-type symmetrical RBF scheme\ncalled as the modified Kansa method (MKM), which differs from the Fasshaure's\nscheme in that the MKM discretizes both governing equation and boundary\nconditions on the same boundary nodes. Therefore, the MKM significantly reduces\ncalculation errors at nodes adjacent to boundary with explicit mathematical\nbasis. Experimenting these novel RBF schemes with 2D and 3D Laplace, Helmholtz,\nand convection-diffusion problems will be subject of this study.
