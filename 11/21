The noise of the resulting\nmass map is investigated here, generalizing previous work which included mainly\nthe noise due to the intrinsic galaxy ellipticities. Whereas this dominates the\nnoise budget if the lens is very weak, other sources of noise become important,\nor even dominant, for the medium-strong lensing regime close to the center of\nclusters. In particular, shot noise due to a Poisson distribution of galaxy\nimages, and increased shot noise owing to the correlation of galaxies in\nangular position and redshift, can yield significantly larger levels of noise\nthan that from the intrinsic ellipticities only.

A significant exchange-mediated enhancement of\nthe excitation gap results in the suppression of the electron-phonon\ninteraction. The rate of absorption of non-equilibrium phonons is calculated as\na function of Zeeman energy and inter-subband splitting. The phonon absorption\nrate has two peaks as a function of intersubband splitting and has a step-like\nstructure as a function of Zeeman energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2001 18:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Our aim is threefold: First, we want to investigate the\ndimensional transition from two to one dimension for three models consisting of\nweakly coupled chains for large dimerizations. Simple scaling arguments show\nthat the interchain coupling is always relevant. The ground states of two of\nthese models therefore have one-dimensional nature only at the decoupling\npoint. The third considered model is more complicated, because it contains\nadditional relevant intrachain couplings leading to a gap as shown by scaling\narguments and numerical investigations. Second, we investigate at which point\nthe dimerization destroys the N\\'eel ordered ground state of the isotropic\nmodel. Within a mapping to a nonlinear sigma-model and linear spinwave theory\n(LSWT) we conclude that the stability of the N\\'eel ordered state depends on\nthe microscopic details of the model. Third, the considered models also can be\nregarded as effective models for a spin system with spin-phonon coupling. This\nleads to the question if a spin-Peierls transition, i.e. a gain of total energy\ndue to lattice distortion, is possible. LSWT shows that such a transition is\npossible under certain conditions leading to a coexistence of long-range order\nand spin-Peierls dimerization. We also find that the gain of magnetic energy is\nlargest for a stair-like distortion of the lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2001 23:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nmagnetic field leads to different transmission amplitudes for spin-up and\nspin-down electrons.\n  In a strong magnetic field the anisotropic two-channel limit corresponds to\ntwo (spin-polarized) orbital channels entering the dot.\n  The physics of the charge fluctuations can be captured using a mapping on the\nchannel-anisotropic two-channel Kondo model.

This\nphase transition is first order. The analytic expression for yields of\ncomposites, in the thermodynamic limit, does not conform to the expression\n$<n_a>=a^{-\\tau}f(a^{\\sigma} (T-T_c))$ where, the usual identification would be\nthat $T_c$ is the critical temperature and $\\tau,\\sigma$ are critical\nexponents.
