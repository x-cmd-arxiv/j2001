The characteristic features of the\nundular and interchange modes are clearly apparent in the simulations. The\nundular mode creates large gas concentrations distributed along the arm. This\nresults in a clear arm/inter-arm difference: the instability triggers the\nformation of large interstellar clouds inside the arms, but generates only\nsmall structures with slight density enhancements in the inter-arm regions. The\nresulting clouds are distributed in an antisymmetric way with respect to the\nmidplane, creating an azimuthal corrugation along the arm. For conditions\nsimilar to those of the optical segment of the Carina-Sagittarius arm, it has a\nwavelength of about 2.4 kpc. This structuring can explain the origin of both HI\nsuperclouds and the azimuthal corrugations in spiral arms. The wavelength\nmatches the corrugation length derived with the young stellar groups located in\nthe optical segment of the Carina-Sagittarius arm.

For this purpose, we numerically solve the\nrelativistic radiation hydrodynamical equation coupled with the accurate\nradiative transfer and quantitatively assess the radiation drag efficiency. As\na result, we find that in an optically thick regime the radiation drag\nefficiency is sensitively dependent on the density distributions of\ninterstellar medium (ISM).

Hence, if the bulge\nformation begins with a star formation event in a clumpy ISM, the radiation\ndrag will effectively work to remove the angular momentum and the accreted gas\nmay form a supermassive black hole. As a natural consequence, this mechanism\nreproduces a putative linear relation between the mass of a supermassive black\nhole and the mass of a galactic bulge, although further detailed modeling for\nstellar evolution is required for the more precise prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2001 08:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

If\nthe new force has a finite range \\lambda, its intensity is proportional to\n1/(\\lambda^2 F^2), F being the extra U(1) symmetry-breaking scale.\n  Quite surprisingly, particle physics experiments can provide constraints on\nsuch a new force, even if it is extremely weak, the corresponding gauge\ncoupling being extremely small (<< 10^-19 !). An ``equivalence theorem'' shows\nthat a very light spin-1 U boson does not in general decouple even when its\ngauge coupling vanishes, but behaves as a quasimassless spin-0 particle, having\npseudoscalar couplings proportional to 1/F. Similarly, in supersymmetric\ntheories, a very light spin-3/2 gravitino might be detectable as a quasi\nmassless spin-1/2 goldstino, despite the extreme smallness of Newton's\ngravitational constant G_N, provided the supersymmetry-breaking scale is not\ntoo large.\n  Searches for such U bosons in \\psi and \\Upsilon decays restrict F to be\nlarger than the electroweak scale (the U actually becoming, as an axion, quasi\n``invisible'' in particle physics for sufficiently large F). This provides\nstrong constraints on the corresponding new force and its associated EP\nviolations. We also discuss briefly new spin-dependent forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2001 14:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
