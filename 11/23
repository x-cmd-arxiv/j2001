To the leading order\nin 1/F, where F is the parameter of supersymmetry breaking, and to zero order\nin MSSM gauge and Yukawa coupling constants, the interactions between the\ncomponent fields of goldstino supermultiplet and MSSM fields are derived.

In gravity-mediated\nsupersymmetry breaking models, a heavy particle can decay into its superpartner\nand a photon-photino pair or a gravitino. Such decays only change the identity\nof a possible dark matter candidate. However, for $10^3 {\\rm GeV} \\leq m_X \\leq\n10^7 {\\rm GeV}$, astrophysical bounds from gamma-ray background and\nphotodissociation of light elements can be more stringent than the overclosure\nbound, thus ruling out the particle as a dark matter candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2001 08:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-07"}

It has been conjectured that the echo of a classically chaotic\nsystem decays exponentially, with a decay rate given by the minimum between the\nwidth $\\Gamma$ of the local density of states and the Lyapunov exponent. As the\nperturbation strength is increased one obtains a cross-over between both\nregimes. These predictions are based on situations where the Fermi Golden Rule\n(FGR) is valid. By considering a paradigmatic fully chaotic system, the\nBunimovich stadium billiard, with a perturbation in a regime for which the FGR\nmanifestly does not work, we find a cross over from $\\Gamma$ to Lyapunov decay.\nWe find that, challenging the analytic interpretation, these conjetures are\nvalid even beyond the expected range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2001 18:38:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2002 13:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

This leads to a separation into\na higher density (``liquid'') symmetric and a low density (``gas'')\nneutron-rich phase, the so-called neutron distillation effect. We analyse the\nsimulations with respect to the time evolution of the isospin dynamics, as well\nas with respect to the distribution and asymmetry of the final primary\nfragments. Qualitatively different effects arise in central collisions, with\nbulk fragmentation, and peripheral collisions with neck-fragmentation. The neck\nfragments produced in this type of process appear systematically more\nneutron-rich from a dynamical nucleon migration effect which is very sensitive\nto the symmetry term in regions just below normal density. In general the\nisospin dynamics plays an important role in all the steps of the reaction, from\nprompt nucleon emission to the sequential decay of the primary fragments. A\nfully microscopic description of the reaction dynamics including stochastic\nelements to treat fluctuations realistically is absolutely necessary in order\nto extract precise information on the fragmentation and the nuclear equation of\nstate.
