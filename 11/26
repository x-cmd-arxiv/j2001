The theory predicts that the exponential voltage-dependence\ncorrelates with the exponential distribution of closed residence times. This\nfeature occurs at large negative voltages when the channel is predominantly\nclosed. In contrast, the linear part of voltage-dependence emerges together\nwith a non-exponential distribution of closed dwelling times with increasing\nvoltage, yielding a large opening rate. Depending on the parameter set, the\nclosed-time distribution displays a power law behavior which extends over\nseveral decades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2001 13:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In the short note (Erkaev et al.,\nPhys. Rev. Lett.,84, 1455 (2000)), the reconnection rate is found by matching\nthe outer Petschek solution and the inner diffusion region solution. Here the\ndetails of the numerical simulation of the diffusion region are presented and\nthe asymptotic procedure which is used for deriving the reconnection rate is\ndescribed. The reconnection rate is obtained as a decreasing function of the\ndiffusion region length. For a sufficiently large diffusion region scale, the\nreconnection rate becomes close to that obtained in the Sweet-Parker solution\nwith the inverse square root dependence on the magnetic Reynolds number,\ndetermined for the global size of the current sheet. On the other hand, for a\nsmall diffusion region length scale, the reconnection rate turns out to be very\nsimilar to that obtained in the Petschek model with a logarithmic dependence on\nthe magnetic Reynolds number. This means that the Petschek regime seems to be\npossible only in the case of a strongly localized conductivity corresponding to\na small scale of the diffusion region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2001 14:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
