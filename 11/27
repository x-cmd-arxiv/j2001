The principal focus is on distinguishing\nbetween, and quantifying, the effects of graininess on initial conditions\ncorresponding, in the continuum limit, to regular and chaotic orbits. Ordinary\nLyapunov exponents X do not provide a useful diagnostic for distinguishing\nbetween regular and chaotic behaviour. Frozen-N orbits corresponding in the\ncontinuum limit to both regular and chaotic characteristics have large positive\nX even though, for large N, the `regular' frozen-N orbits closely resemble\nregular characteristics in the smooth potential. Viewed macroscopically both\n`regular' and `chaotic' frozen-N orbits diverge as a power law in time from\nsmooth orbits with the same initial condition. There is, however, an important\ndifference between `regular' and `chaotic' frozen-N orbits: For regular orbits,\nthe time scale associated with this divergence t_G ~ N^{1/2}t_D, with t_D a\ncharacteristic dynamical time; for chaotic orbits t_G ~ (ln N) t_D. At least\nfor N>1000 or so, clear distinctions exist between phase mixing of initially\nlocalised orbit ensembles which, in the continuum limit, exhibit regular versus\nchaotic behaviour. For both regular and chaotic ensembles, finite-N effects are\nwell mimicked, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by energy-conserving\nwhite noise with amplitude ~ 1/N. This suggests strongly that earlier\ninvestigations of the effects of low amplitude noise on phase space transport\nin smooth potentials are directly relevant to real physical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2001 22:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

To explain\nthis behavior, a model has been developed in which polarons interact via both\nthe standard direct carrier-carrier exchange interaction (due to virtual\ncarrier hopping) and an indirect carrier-ion-carrier exchange interaction (due\nto the interactions of polarons with magnetic ions in an interstitial region).\nUsing a variational procedure, the optimal values of the model parameters were\ndetermined as a function of temperature.

A number\nof applications are discussed in these lectures, including semileptonic B-meson\ndecays, two-photon exclusive reactions, diffractive dissociation into jets, and\ndeeply virtual Compton scattering. The relation of the intrinsic sea to the\nlight-front wavefunctions is discussed. Light-front quantization can also be\nused in the Hamiltonian form to construct an event generator for high energy\nphysics reactions at the amplitude level. The light-cone partition function,\nsummed over exponentially-weighted light-cone energies, has simple boost\nproperties which may be useful for studies in heavy ion collisions.

A group of reconsidered conjectures and a\ncorresponding new approach are set forth. The quantum measurements, regarded\nexperimentally as statistical samplings, are described theoretically by means\nof linear integral transforms of quantum probability density and current, from\nintrinsic into recorded readings. Accordingly, the quantum observables appear\nas random variables, valuable, in both readings, through probabilistic\nnumerical parameters (characteristics). The measurements uncertainties (errors)\nare described by means of the intrinsic-recorded changes for the alluded\nparameters or for the informational entropies. The present approach, together\nwith other author's investigations, give a natural and unified reconsideration\nof primary problems of Heisenberg's relations and quantum measurements. The\nrespective reconsideration can offer some nontrivial elements for an expected\nre-examination of some disputed subsequent questions regarding the foundations\nand interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2001 18:10:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2001 12:56:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2001 14:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
