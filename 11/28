Both\nWR146 and WR147 are known to have strong non-thermal radio emission arising in\na wind-wind collision shock zone between the WR and OB components.

Because of the small\nmass-loss rate of the B star component in WR86, the wind collision region must\nbe closer to the B star and smaller in effective area, hence generating smaller\namounts of non-thermal radio emission. Absolute magnitudes for all the stars\nare estimated based on the spectral types of the components (based on the\ntables by Schmidt-Kaler for OB stars, and van der Hucht for WR stars), and\ncompared with actual, observed magnitude differences. While the derived\nluminosities for the WC7 and B0 III stars in WR86 are consistent with the\nobserved magnitude difference, we find a discrepancy of at least 1.5 magnitudes\nbetween the observed luminosities of the components in each of WR146 and WR147\nand the absolute magnitudes expected from their spectral types.

Here we investigate more realistic\ncosmological microlensing statistics by considering the strong spatial\nclustering of likely lensing objects with each other in galaxies and their\nassociation with the clumps of dark matter that make up the massive halos of\ngalaxies. The distribution of microlensing optical depth (kappa) along randomly\nchosen sight lines is calculated as is the conditional distribution of kappa\nalong sight lines near one which is strongly microlensed. Our overall result is\nthat the Press-Gunn approximation is a useful order-of-magnitude approximation\nif the massive halos of galaxies are made of dark compact objects but that it\nfails badly and can be qualitatively misleading in the more likely case in\nwhich only the ordinary stellar populations of galaxies are the dominant source\nof cosmological microlensing events.
