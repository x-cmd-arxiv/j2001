Recent observational evidence from very-high energy (VHE, energies\nabove 100 GeV) gamma-ray measurements is in contradiction with the surmise that\nsynchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons is indicative for hadron\nacceleration. It rather points to a CR-acceleration efficiency of supernova\nremnants (SNRs) below one percent, much less than the value required if these\nobjects were to be the main sources of Galactic cosmic rays (about 30%).\nObservations of CR anisotropy and the emission of low-energy (energy < 10 GeV)\ngamma-rays from the Galactic disk indicate that the sources of low-energy\ncosmic rays are distributed with a Galactocentric radial scale length in the\norder of 25 +- 10 kpc, much larger than expected if SNRs are the main sources\nof CRs. These two facts - together with the body of evidence from CR isotope\nabundances - strongly suggest that a new class of astrophysical objects -\ndistinct from SNRs and located manly in the outer reaches of our Galaxy - is\nthe major source of hadronic CRs in our Galaxy. The basic observational\nfeatures of ultra high-energy (UHE, energy > 10^{19} eV) CRs are most naturally\nunderstood if the same CR sources accelerate CRs up to the highest observed CR\nenergies.

In terms of this action we calculate\nthe related Aharonov--Bohm phase and show that it also yields the same\neffective magnetic field. When magnetic field is strong enough this phase\nbecomes independent of magnetic field. Measurement of it may give some hints on\nspatial noncommutativity.

Under the EPICS environment, we\nare challenging to implement the Ethernet/IP network for all communication,\neven at the level of end-point controllers which are so far connected via a\nfield bus. In order to realize such a system, three new controllers (PLCs,\nWE7000 stations and general-purpose Ethernet boards) are being developed. A\nprototype EPICS driver for the PLCs works fine and is used to control the\nion-source at the KEK Linac.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2001 17:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
