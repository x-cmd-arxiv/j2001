We start from the partition function\nin the canonical ensemble which we express as a functional integral over the\ndensities of the two kinds of particles for a large number of particles. The\nsystem is shown to possess an infinite volume limit when (N_1,N_2,V)->infty,\nkeeping N_1/V^{1/3} and N_2/V^{1/3} fixed. The saddle point approximation\nbecomes here exact for (N_1,N_2,V)->infty.It provides a nonlinear differential\nequation on the particle densities. For the spherically symmetric case, we\ncompute the densities as functions of two dimensionless physical parameters:\neta_1=G m_1^2 N_1/[V^{1/3} T] and eta_2=G m_2^2 N_2/[V^{1/3} T] (where G is\nNewton's constant, m_1 and m_2 the masses of the two kinds of particles and T\nthe temperature). According to the values of eta_1 and eta_2 the system can be\neither in a gaseous phase or in a highly condensed phase.The gaseous phase is\nstable for eta_1 and eta_2 between the origin and their collapse values. The\ngas is inhomogeneous and the mass M(R) inside a sphere of radius R scales with\nR as M(R) propto R^d suggesting a fractal structure. The value of d depends in\ngeneral on eta_1 and eta_2 except on the critical line for the canonical ensem-\nble where it takes the universal value d simeq 1.6 for all values of N_1/N_2.\nThe equation of state is computed.It is found to be locally a perfect gas\nequation of state. Thermodynamic functions are computed as functions of eta_1\nand eta_2. They exhibit a square root Riemann sheet with the branch points on\nthe critical canonical line.

Striking features of the Chandra X-ray image\nare an incomplete elliptical arc and a possible jet, similar to the structures\nthat dominate the appearance of the Vela PWN. Approximately 70% of the 2-10 keV\nX-ray emission comes from a centrally peaked, diffuse nebula of radius 100\"\nwith a power-law spectrum of photon index 1.45 +/- 0.19. The pulsar itself has\na marginally harder spectrum with photon index 0.99 +/- 0.27. For an assumed\ndistance of 3 kpc the ratio of X-ray luminosity to spin-down power of PSR\nJ2229+6114 is only 8 x 10^{-5}. We discuss a model in which such inefficient\nX-ray emission is the signature of a highly magnetized pulsar wind that\nprevents an internal MHD shock, at the location of the X-ray arc, from strongly\ncompressing the flow. The incomplete X-ray arc is consistent with beaming from\na relativistic equatorial outflow, while a surrounding radio shell is probably\nthe forward shock in the surrounding ISM. An MeV source at this location was\npreviously detected by the COMPTEL experiment on CGRO. This, plus the flat\nX-ray spectrum in the 2-10 keV band, suggests that PSR J2229+6114 is one of the\nbrightest pulsars at 1 MeV, even while it is inconspicuous at radio through\nX-ray wavelengths, and as steep as the Crab above 100 MeV. The apparent variety\nof broad-band spectra displayed by high-energy pulsars bolsters the theory that\nrotation-powered pulsars dominate the unidentified Galactic EGRET source\npopulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2001 00:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Instead,\nthe strange star evolves towards a quasi-equilibrium state on a timescale of\nabout a year. This mechanism could thus explain the clustering of\nspin-frequencies inferred from kHz QPO data in Low-mass X-ray binaries.

The QMF consists of\na 4-dimensional space-time manifold equipped with two one-parameter families of\nLorentzian 4-metrics ${\\bf g}_t$ and ${\\bf {\\bar g}}_t$ parametrized by a\n(unique) global time function $t$. The global time function represents one\nextra degenerate time dimension and it defines a \"distinguished\" foliation of\nquasi-metric space-time into spatial hypersurfaces. The metric family ${\\bf\n{\\bar g}}_t$ is found as solutions of field equations, whereas the metric\nfamily ${\\bf g}_t$ is found via a local transformation ${\\bf {\\bar\ng}}_t{\\rightarrow}{\\bf g}_t$ and is used in the equations of motion. The role\nof the degenerate dimension is to describe global scale changes between\ngravitational and non-gravitational systems. In particular, this yields an\nalternative description of the expansion of the Universe. In this thesis, a\nquasi-metric theory of gravity is constructed. Like General Relativity, the\nfield equations have two independent propagating dynamical degrees of freedom.\nHowever, a number of non-standard features makes the field equations unsuitable\nfor a standard PPN-analysis. This implies that the experimental status of the\ntheory is not completely clear at this point in time. But the non-metric part\nof the theory may be tested rather independently. That is, the theory predicts\nthat gravitational fields in vacuum and gravitationally bound bodies made of\nideal gas expand like the expansion of the Universe. Several observations\nsuggest this; e.g., the \"Pioneer effect\", the mean acceleration of the Moon,\nthe spin-down of the Earth, palaeo-tidal records, etc. Thus quasi-metric\nrelativity has experimental support where metric theories fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2001 02:42:02 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2005 07:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2005 23:33:18 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2005 05:11:52 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 16:08:26 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2019 09:47:49 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 11:45:11 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 23:16:54 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 10:39:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2001 22:07:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2002 20:04:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2002 03:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 4 May 2002 17:14:50 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2003 00:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2003 18:27:42 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2004 02:30:23 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2004 17:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

A description of nonperturbative effect related to $J/\\psi$ can\nbe made by using NRQCD. In the forward region of the kinematics, the\ninteraction between the $c\\bar c$-pair and the initial hadron is due to\nexchange of soft gluons. The effect of the exchange can be studied by using the\nexpansion in the inverse of the quark mass $m_c$. At the leading order we find\nthat the nonperturbative effect related to the initial hadron is represented by\na matrix element of field strength operators, which are separated in the moving\ndirection of $J/\\psi$ in the space-time. The S-matrix element is then obtained\nwithout using perturbative QCD and the results are not based on any model.\nCorrections to the results can be systematically added. Keeping the dominant\ncontribution of the S-matrix element in the large energy limit we find that the\nimaginary part of the S-matrix element is related to the gluon distribution for\n$x\\to 0$ with a reasonable assumption, the real part can be obtained with\nanother approximation or with dispersion relation.

We relate the existence of a (conformal)\nKilling spinor to the existence of certain closed and co-closed p-forms, and to\nthe metric being Ricci flat or Einstein. Then, for seven-dimensional manifolds,\nwe show that octonionic self-duality conditions on the spin connection are\nequivalent to G_2 holonomy and certain generalized self-duality conditions to\nweak G_2 holonomy. The latter lift to self-duality conditions for\ncohomogeneity-one spin(7) metrics. To illustrate the power of this approach, we\npresent several examples where the self-duality condition largely simplifies\nthe derivation of a G_2 or weak G_2 metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2001 16:00:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2002 14:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

(See math.DG/0505013 for part\nII).\n  The Floer homology can be trivial in many variants of the Floer theory; it is\ntherefore interesting to consider more refined invariants of the Floer complex.\nWe consider one such instance--the Reidemeister torsion (\\tau_F) of the\nFloer-Novikov complex of (possibly non-hamiltonian) symplectomorphisms.\n(\\tau_F) turns out NOT to be invariant under hamiltonian isotopies, but this\nfailure may be fixed by introducing certain ``correction term'': We define a\nFloer-theoretic zeta function (\\zeta_F), by counting perturbed\npseudo-holomorphic tori in a way very similar to the genus 1 Gromov invariant.\nThe main result of this article states that under suitable monotonicity\nconditions, the product (I_F:=\\tau_F\\zeta_F) is invariant under hamiltonian\nisotopies. In fact, (I_F) is invariant under general symplectic isotopies when\nthe underlying symplectic manifold (M) is monotone.\n  Because the torsion invariant we consider is not a homotopy invariant, the\ncontinuation method used in typical invariance proofs of Floer theory does not\napply; instead, the detailed bifurcation analysis is worked out.
