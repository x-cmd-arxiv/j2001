From\nthe combined study of the radio and X-ray data we have estimated a central\nvalue of 3<Bo (muG)<9. We also present the most recent results from the\nanalysis of the radio data on the pc-scale structure of the radio galaxy,\nobserved at 18 cm by the EVN-MERLIN array. A faint but compact radio source,\ncoincident with the optical centre of Hercules A was detected by the EVN at 18\nmas resolution. The total flux density of the EVN core is 14.6 mJy. Its angular\nsize is 18 x 7 mas with a position angle of ~139 degrees. There is also\nevidence for extended emission in the NW-SE direction, most probably from the\neastern pc-scale jet. If this is true then there is a misalignment between the\ndirection of the pc-eastern and the aligned kpc-scale jets of ~35 degrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2001 20:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We emphasize\nthe difference in mechanisms of the bulk and surface conductivity as indicated\nby their different temperature behaviors. In addition, the existence of a thin\n(10-100 A) oxide layer on the surface of CZT, formed during the fabrication\nprocess, affects both bulk and surface leakage currents. We demonstrate that\nthe measured I-V dependencies of bulk current can be explained by considering\nthe CZT detector as a metal-semiconductor-metal system with two back-to-back\nSchottky-barrier contacts. The high surface leakage current is apparently due\nto the presence of a low-resistivity surface layer that has characteristics\nwhich differ considerably from those of the bulk material. This surface layer\nhas a profound effect on the charge collection efficiency in detectors with\nmulti-contact geometry; some fraction of the electric field lines originated on\nthe cathode intersects the surface areas between the pixel contacts where the\ncharge produced by an ionizing particle gets trapped. To overcome this effect\nwe place a grid of thin electrodes between the pixel contacts; when the grid is\nnegatively biased, the strong electric field in the gaps between the pixels\nforces the electrons landing on the surface to move toward the contacts,\npreventing the charge loss. We have investigated these effects by using CZT\npixel detectors indium bump bonded to a custom-built VLSI readout chip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2001 22:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The DFS is spanned by states that are\nunaffected by arbitrary collective phase noise. Encoding and decoding\nprocedures reversibly map an arbitrary qubit state from a single data spin to\nthe DFS and back. The implementation demonstrates the robustness of the DFS\nmemory against engineered dephasing with arbitrary strength as well as a\nsubstantial increase in the amount of quantum information retained, relative to\nan un-encoded qubit, under both engineered and natural noise processes. In\naddition, a universal set of logical manipulations over the encoded qubit is\nalso realized. Although intrinsic limitations prevent maintaining full noise\ntolerance during quantum gates, we show how the use of dynamical control\nmethods at the encoded level can ensure that computation is protected with\nfinite distance.

Thus, it is not possible\nto express the dynamics in terms of a convolution of a positive transition\nprobability function and the initial condition as can be done in the classical\ncase.
