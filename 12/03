A large change in flux (factor ~50 at 1keV) is observed between an ASCA\nobservation in '94 and the Chandra observation in 2000, with the source close\nto the all-time maximum and minimum X-ray flux states, respectively. We find\nthe variations in the observed flux and spectra at these epochs to be\nconsistent with a constant column density of line-of-sight material reacting to\nchanges in the ionizing continuum. The data from the two epochs are consistent\nwith a simple decrease (by a factor 8-10) in the luminosity of a constant\n0.5-50 keV slope source and a line-of-sight absorber with an equivalent\nhydrogen column density of 10^21.9 cm^-2.

The images show an oval\nshaped area (\"bulge\") of 11x16 arcsec or 450x650 pc around the nucleus,\ndominated by a smooth population of old stars with overimposed dust lanes. We\nfound 30 bright point-like sources in the bulge of M51; many of these are\nbright in the UV. They are located in elongated \"strings\" which follow the\ngeneral pattern of the dust lanes. The spectral energy distributions of the\npointsources are compared with those of clusters or single stars. We present\narguments that the pointsources are isolated massive stars or small groups of a\nfew massive stars. The energy distributions are best fitted with those of\nsingle stars with 4000<Teff<50000 K, 4.2<log L/Lsun<7.2, and 12<Mstar<200 Msun.\nWe have derived upper limits to the total mass of low mass stars that could be\n\"hiding\" within the point sources. For the bluest sources the upper limit is\nonly a few hundred Msun. We conclude that massive stars are formed outside\nclusters (or in very low mass clusters) in the bulge of M51. The estimated star\nformation rate in the bulge is 1 to 2x10^(-3) Msun/yr. This star formation rate\ncould be sustained for about 200 to 400 Myrs, suggesting that the ongoing\nmassive star formation in the bulge of M51 is fed/triggered by the interaction\nwith its companion about 400 Mrs ago. Theoretical cloud-models show that CO is\ndestroyed in low extinction clouds near the bright nucleus of M51, so that H_2,\n[OI] and [CII] are the dominants coolants. This condition favors the formation\nof massive stars, in agreement with the observations. This mode of massive-star\nformation in the bulge of M51 may resemble the star formation in the early\nUniverse, when the CO and dust contents were low due to the low metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2001 15:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is shown that the dynamics can be described in\nterms of the evolution of the point charge which satisfies a fourth order\ndifferential equation or, alternatively, as a system of second order\ndifferential equations by describing the evolution of both the center of mass\nand center of charge of the particle. As an application of the found dynamical\nequations, the Coulomb interaction between two spinning electrons is\nconsidered. We find from the classical viewpoint that these spinning electrons\ncan form bound states under suitable initial conditions. Since the classical\nCoulomb interaction of two spinless point electrons does not allow for the\nexistence of bound states, it is the spin structure that gives rise to new\nphysical phenomena not described in the spinless case.
