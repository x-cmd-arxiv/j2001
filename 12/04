Here some of the consequences of assuming such a local\nmodel for QSOs are examined. From the ages of the ejection events it is found\nthat in a relatively short time (10 - 100 million years) the intrinsic redshift\ncomponent in these objects disappears and their luminosity increases to a value\nclose to that of a normal galaxy. This period may then determine the\napproximate lifetime of a QSO and, in this scenario, QSOs may represent the\nfirst, short-lived stage in the life of a galaxy. It is shown that when QSOs\nare assumed to be \"local\", their generation rate is found to be constant\nthroughout the age of the Universe. There is no need to invoke an epoch of\nenhanced, high-luminosity QSO production as is required if their redshifts are\nassumed to be purely cosmological. Because QSO lifetimes are relatively short\n(less than 100 million yrs), an initial event (Big Bang) may still be required\nto explain the high-redshift galaxies whose intrinsic redshift component will\nhave long since disappeared.

Another\nfactor (relevant for comets) is outgassing. Due to impacts, tidal forces and\noutgassing, the asteroidal and cometary precession must be a generic\nphenomenon: while some rotators are in the state of visible tumbling, a much\nlarger amount of objects must be performing narrow-cone precession not so\neasily observable from the Earth. The internal dissipation in a freely\nprecessing top leads to relaxation (gradual damping of the precession) and\nsometimes to spontaneous changes in the rotation axis. Recently developed\ntheory of dissipative precession of a rigid body reveals that this is a highly\nnonlinear process: while the body is precessing at an angular rate $ \\omega$,\nthe precession-caused stresses and strains in the body contain components\noscillating at other frequencies. Dependent upon the spin state, those\nfrequencies may be higher or, most remarkably, lower than the precession rate.\nIn many states dissipation at the harmonics is comparable to or even exceeds\nthat at the principal frequency. For this and other reasons, in many spin\nstates the damping of asteroidal and cometary wobble happens faster, by several\norders, than believed previously. This makes it possible to measure the\nprecession-damping rate. The narrowing of the precession cone through the\nperiod of about a year can be registered by the currently available\nspacecraft-based observational means. However, in the near-separatrix spin\nstates a precessing rotator can considerably slow down its relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2001 23:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2001 05:04:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 May 2002 21:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We discussed in a previous paper that a population with a fast\nevolving infrared burst phase triggered by gas rich mergers at z~1 interpreted\nsuccessfully the steep slope of IRAS 60um counts, leaving still a reasonable\nCIRB level at this wavelength. To extend the model to mid- and far-IR, we adopt\na template SED as typical for nearby IR bright galaxies, such as Arp220. We\nconstruct the SED for the starburst mergers at z~1 by a simple dust extinction\nlaw and a thermal continuum assumption for the FIR emission. Since the\nradiation process at MIR for the merging systems is still uncertain, we assume\nit is similar to that of Arp220, but modify it by the observed flux correlation\nof ULIGs from IRAS, ISOCAM deep surveys. We show in this paper that the strong\nevolution of the ELAIS 90um, ISO 170um and the SCUBA 850um could be\nsufficiently accounted for by such an evolutionary scenario, especially for the\nhump of the ISOCAM 15um source count around 0.4mJy. From current best fit\nresults, we find that the dust temperature of those merging system at z~1 would\nbe higher than that of Arp220 for a reconciliation of the multi-wavelength deep\nsurveys.

A\nchange of basis from energy levels to wave packets amounts to a discrete\nquantum Fourier transform within each atom. The algorithm then reduces to a\nseries of conditional phase transforms between two entangled atoms in mixed\nenergy and wave-packet bases. We show how to implement such transforms using\nwave-packet control of the internal states of the ions in the linear ion-trap\nscheme for quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2001 22:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
