This result is obtained from simulations\nwith live haloes, i.e. composed of particles which respond to the disc and take\npart in the evolution. On the other hand, if the halo is rigid, it hinders or\nquenches bar formation, as expected.

Following the orbits of the stars in the halo, I find that a\nconsiderable fraction of the halo particles are in resonance with the bar.

We also show that a time dependent wave packet\npassing through the system of potential barriers rapidly spreads and deforms, a\ncriterion suggested by Zaslavsky for chaotic behaviour. Computing the spectrum\nby imposing (large) periodic boundary conditions we find a Wigner type\ndistribution. We investigate also the S-matrix poles; many resonances occur for\ncertain values of the relative spacing between the barriers in the potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2001 15:20:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2003 20:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
