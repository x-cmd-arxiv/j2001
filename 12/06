The non-enhancement\nof the continuum emission in the spectrum of image B suggests that the\ncontinuum emission region is concentrated closer to the center of the accretion\ndisk than the iron line emission region and the magnification caustic has not\nreached close enough to the former region to amplify it.

Only two of the 28 optically-identified SNRs are detected\nat another wavelength. The most noteworthy source in our study is N7793-S26,\nwhich is the only SNR that is detected at all three wavelengths. It features a\nlong (approximately 450 pc) filamentary morphology that is clearly seen in both\nthe optical and radio images. N7793-S26's radio luminosity exceeds that of the\nGalactic SNR Cas A, and based on equipartition calculations we determine that\nan energy of at least 10^52 ergs is required to maintain this source. A second\noptically identified SNR, N7793-S11, has detectable radio emission but is not\ndetected in the X-ray. Complementary X-ray and radio searches for SNRs have\nyielded five new candidate radio SNRs, to be added to the 28 SNRs in this\ngalaxy that have already been detected by optical methods.

In order to investigate\nstatistical properties of the central cool component, we performed systematic\nanalysis of ASCA data on 85 clusters.

On the\nassumption that z_abs ~ z_em DLAs are neither ejecta from the QSO, nor part of\nthe host galaxy itself, we use the number density statistics of these DLAs to\ninvestigate galaxy clustering near the QSO redshift. We find that n(z) of z_abs\n\\~z_em DLAs in our radio-selected QSO sample is ~4 times larger than the number\ndensity of intervening DLAs, implying an excess of galaxies near the QSO. This\nresult is further supported with the inclusion of the radio-loud QSOs in the\nFIRST survey, although the total number of DLAs is still small (4) and the\nresult is currently only significant at approximately the 2 sigma level. Since\nall of the z_abs ~ z_em DLAs we identify in CORALS are found towards optically\nbright (B < 20) QSOs, there is no strong evidence (based on these limited\nstatistics) that this population suffers from a severe dust bias. We compare\nour results with those from an optically-selected, radio-quiet QSO sample in\norder to determine whether there is evidence for an excess of galaxies around\nradio-loud versus radio-quiet QSOs.

Finally, we\nreport that one of the new z_abs ~ z_em DLAs discovered by CORALS has some\nresidual flux in the base of the Lya trough which may be due to Lya emission,\neither from star formation in the DLA galaxy or from gas photoionised by the\nQSO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2001 12:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

From our Doppler tomography\nresults, we find that the white dwarf has M geq 0.7 Msun. Our indirect imaging\nof the accretion stream suggests that the stream is brightest close to the\nwhite dwarf.

In\nthat sense, it complements the earlier work of Balsara and Spicer (1999) where\nwe discussed the divergence-free time-update of vector fields which satisfy\nStoke's law type evolution equations. Our advance in divergence-free\nreconstruction of vector fields is such that it reduces to the total variation\ndiminishing (TVD) property for one-dimensional evolution and yet goes beyond it\nin multiple dimensions. Divergence-free restriction is also discussed. An\nelectric field correction strategy is presented for use on AMR meshes. The\nelectric field correction strategy helps preserve the divergence-free evolution\nof the magnetic field even when the time steps are sub-cycled on refined\nmeshes.

Quantitative understanding of and\nprecise physical control over donor (e.g. Phosphorus) exchange are crucial\nelements in the physics underlying the proposed Si-based quantum computer\nhardware. An important potential problem in this context is that inter-valley\ninterference originating from the degeneracy in the Si conduction band edge\ncauses fast oscillations in donor exchange coupling, which imposes significant\nconstraints on the Si quantum computer architecture.

We show, using the\nKohn-Luttinger envelope function approach, that fast oscillations in exchange\ncoupling indeed disappear for donor pairs that satisfy certain conditions for\ntheir relative positions, while in other situations the donor exchange coupling\nremains oscillatory, with periods close to interatomic spacing.
