In both Bars, the H2 emission is generally distributed in clumps\nalong filamentary features. The 1-0 S(1) and 2-1 S(1) images have similar\nmorphologies.

In\nthis brief contribution to the Proceedings of the NATO-ASI on ``Electrostatic\nEffects in Soft Matter and Biophysics'', which took place in Les Houches from\nOct. 1-13, 2000, we provide an introduction to both ideas and summarize a few\nimportant results which can be obtained from them. We outline the sequence of\napproximations which ultimately lead to the cell-model. Then we present two\nexact results, namely, an expression for the osmotic pressure and a formula for\nthe ion density at the surface of the macromolecule, known as the contact value\ntheorem. The next section provides a derivation of the Poisson-Boltzmann\nequation from a variational principle and the assumption of a product state.\nAfterwards we apply Poisson-Boltzmann theory to the cell-model of linear\npolyelectrolytes. In particular, the behavior of the exact solution in the\nlimit of zero density is compared to the concept of Manning condensation.\nFinally, we demonstrate how a system described by a cell model can be coupled\nto a salt reservoir, i.e., how the so-called Donnan equilibrium is established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2001 16:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By exploiting quantum\ncorrelations such as entanglement, coupled quantum channels can communicate at\na potentially higher rate than unentangled quantum channels given the same\npower. In particular, given the same overall power, M coupled, entangled\nquantum channels can send M bits in the same time it takes a single channel to\nsend a single bit, and in the same time it takes M unentangled channels to send\n$\\sqrt M$ bits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2001 21:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Two types of\ncriteria for EPR correlations are determined. The first type are based on\nmeasurements of the variances of conditional probability distributions and are\nnecessary to reflect directly the situation of the original EPR paradox. The\nsecond weaker set of EPR criteria are based on the proven failure of\n(Bell-type) local realistic theories which could be consistent with a local\nquantum description for each subsystem. The relationship with criteria\nsufficient to prove entanglement is established, to show that any demonstration\nof EPR correlations will also signify entanglement. It is also shown how a\ndemonstration of entanglement between two spatially separated subsystems, if\nnot able to interpreted as a violation of a Bell-type inequality, may be\ninterpreted as a demonstration of the EPR correlations.
