We\nhave also computed the integrated light from individual galaxy counts in the\nimages used to measure the EBL and in the Hubble Deep Field. We find that the\nflux in galaxies as measured by standard galaxy photometry methods has\ngenerally been underestimated by about 50%. Further, we find that the total\nflux in individually detected galaxies is a factor of 2 to 3 less than the EBL\nat 3000--8000A. We show that a significant fraction of the EBL may come from\nnormal galaxies at z<4, which are simply undetectable as a result of\nK-corrections and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This is consistent\nwith recent redshift surveys at z<4. In the context of some simple models, we\ndiscuss the constraints placed by the EBL on the evolution of the luminosity\ndensity at z>1. Based on our optical EBL and published UV and IR EBL\nmeasurements, we estimate that the total EBL from 0.1--1000 microns is 100+/-20\nnW/m^2/sr. If the total EBL were produced entirely by stellar nucleosynthesis,\nthen we estimate that the total baryonic mass processed through stars is\nOmega_* = 0.0062 (+/- 0.0022) h^{-2}, which corresponds to 0.33+/-0.12 Omega_B\nfor currently favored values of the baryon density. This estimate is smaller by\nroughly 7% if 7 h_{0.7} nW/m^2/sr of the total EBL comes from accretion onto\ncentral black holes. This estimate of Omega_* suggests that the universe has\nbeen enriched to a total metal mass of 0.21(+/-0.13) Z_sun Omega_B. Our\nestimate is consistent with other measurements of the cumulative metal mass\nfraction of stars, stellar remnants, and the intracluster medium of galaxy\nclusters in the local universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2001 18:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Similar variations in CH appear to be present in the main sequence\nturnoff spectra. There is no sign of a change in the behavior of C and N with\nevolutionary stage over the full range in luminosity of the RGB and SGB. The C\nand N abundances appear strongly anti-correlated, as would be expected from the\nCN-cycle processing of stellar material. Yet the present stars are considerably\nfainter than the RGB bump, the point at which deep mixing is believed to set\nin. On this basis, while the observed abundance pattern is consistent with\nproton capture nucleosynthesis, we infer that the site of the reactions is\nlikely not within the present sample, but rather in a population of more\nmassive (2 -- 5 M(Sun)) now defunct stars. The range of variation of the N\nabundances is very large and the sum of C+N increases as C decreases. To\nreproduce this requires the incorporation not only of CN but also of\nON-processed material. Furthermore, the existence of this correlation is quite\ndifficult to reproduce with an external mechanism such as ``pollution'' with\nmaterial processed in a more massive AGB star, which mechanism is fundamentally\nstochastic in nature. We therefore suggest that although the internal mixing\nhypothesis has serious flaws,new theoretical insights are needed and it should\nnot be ruled out yet.

The particular\nvelocity values in these fragments vary in a wide range. In contrast, the flow\nrate is more or less constant because its fluctuations are mainly due to the\ndiscreteness of traffic flow.\n  Subsequently, we develop a model for synchronized traffic that can explain\nthese characteristics. Following previous work (I.A.Lubashevsky, R.Mahnke,\nPhys. Rev. E v. 62, p. 6082, 2000) the vehicle flow is specified by car\ndensity, mean velocity, and additional order parameters $h$ and $a$ that are\ndue to the many-particle effects of the vehicle interaction. The parameter $h$\ndescribes the multilane correlations in the vehicle motion. Together with the\ncar density it determines directly the mean velocity. The parameter $a$, in\ncontrast, controls the evolution of $h$ only. The model assumes that $a$\nfluctuates randomly around the value corresponding to the car configuration\noptimal for lane changing. When it deviates from this value the lane change is\ndepressed for all cars forming a local cluster. Since exactly the overtaking\nmanoeuvres of these cars cause the order parameter $a$ to vary, the evolution\nof the car arrangement becomes frozen for a certain time.

The\nHermite kernel is constructed by using the discrete singular convolution (DSC)\nalgorithm, which provides a systematic generation of low-pass filter and its\nconjugate high-pass filters. The high-pass filters are utilized for\napproximating spatial derivatives in solving flow equations, while the\nconjugate low-pass filter is activated to eliminate spurious oscillations\naccumulated during the time evolution of a flow. As both low-pass and high-pass\nfilters are derived from the Hermite kernel, they have similar regularity,\ntime-frequency localization, effective frequency band and compact support.\nFourier analysis indicates that the CFOR-Hermite scheme yields a nearly optimal\nresolution and has a better approximation to the ideal low-pass filter than\npreviously CFOR schemes. Thus, it has better potential for resolving natural\nhigh frequency oscillations from a shock. Extensive one- and two-dimensional\nnumerical examples, including both incompressible and compressible flows, with\nor without shocks, are employed to explore the utility, test the resolution,\nand examine the stability of the present CFOR-Hermite scheme. Extremely small\nratio of point-per-wavelength (PPW) is achieved in solving the Taylor problem,\nadvancing a wavepacket and resolving a shock/entropy wave interaction.

The effect is found in the framework of exact coherent-product\nsolutions for model registers decohering in a bath of degenerate harmonic\nmodes, through couplings linear in bath coordinates. These solutions represent\na natural nonequilibrium extension of the standard solution for a decoupled\ninitial register state and a thermal environment. Under appropriate conditions,\nthe corresponding reduced register distribution can propagate in an unperturbed\nmanner, even in the presence of entanglement between states belonging to\ndistinct decoherence free subspaces, and despite persistent bath entanglement.\nAs a byproduct, we also obtain a refined picture of coherence dynamics under\nbang-bang decoherence control. In particular, it is shown that each\nradio-frequency pulse in a typical bang-bang cycle induces a revival of\ncoherence, and that these revivals are exploited in a natural way by the\ntime-symmetrized version of the bang-bang protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2001 20:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2002 18:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The solution covers all\n\"single\" particle three-dimensional Schroedinger theory linear or nonlinear and\nwith any external potential present. The system is classical, set in a\nsix-dimensional space and involves vacuum polarization as the background\nprocess. Basic vacuum polarization energy characterised oscillators are\nidentified and then in assemblies are analysed in terms of energy occurrence\nfrequencies. The orbits of polarization monopoles are given and shown to be\nelliptical on subspaces surfaces. The basic process takes place at the speed of\nlight and is of a statistical \"zitterbewegung\" character. The orthodox quantum\nprobability density bilinear quadratic form is derived from angular momentum\nconsideration within the system which is shown to be a generalisation of the\nusual quantum structure. Two statistical assemblies are identified, a linear\none associated with superposition of eigenfunctions and a quadratic one\nassociated with interactions between eigenstates. It is suggested that this\ntwo-tier probabilistic system will remove some possible paradoxes that plague\nthe orthodox thoory.
