Close to the first bifurcation destabilizing the\nspatially uniform solution, a stationary single-humped solution is found in an\nasymptotic analytical form, which turns out to be in very good agreement with\nthe numerical results.

The assumption that there are no causal laws,\nbut only probabilities for physical processes constrained by symmetries, leads\nnaturally to quantum mechanics. In particular, an argument is made for why\nthere are probability amplitudes that are complex numbers, which obey the Born\nrule for quantum probabilities. This argument generalizes the Feynman path\nintegral formulation of quantum mechanics to include all possible actions that\nare allowed by symmetries, but only the lowest order terms are observable at\nthe presently accessible energy scales. The notion of relational reality is\nintroduced in order to give physical meaning to probabilities.

We only assume the invariance with respect to the Poincare'\ngroup; and only requiring the conservation of the linear and angular momenta we\nderive the zitterbewegung: namely the decomposition of the 4-velocity in the\nnewtonian constant term p/m and in a non-newtonian time-oscillating spacelike\nterm. Consequently, free classical particles do not obey, in general, the\nPrinciple of Inertia. Superluminal motions are also allowed, without violating\nSpecial Relativity, provided that the energy-momentum moves along the worldline\nof the center-of-mass. Moreover, a non-linear, non-constant relation holds\nbetween the time durations measured in different reference frames. Newtonian\nMechanics is re-obtained as a particular case of the present theory: namely for\nspinless systems with no zitterbewegung. Introducing a Lagrangian containing\nalso derivatives of the 4-velocity we get a new equation of the motion,\nactually a generalization of the Newton Law a=F/m. Requiring the rotational\nsymmetry and the reparametrization invariance we derive the classical spin\nvector and the conserved scalar Hamiltonian, respectively. We derive also the\nclassical Dirac spin and analyze the general solution of the Eulero-Lagrange\nequation for Dirac particles.
