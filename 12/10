However, these fluctuations occur on time\nscales which are typically of the order of the light travel time between the\natom and the plate. As a consequence, they will not be observed in an\nexperiment which measures the force averaged over a much longer time. In the\nlarge time limit, the magnitude of the mean squared velocity of a test particle\ndue to this fluctuating Van der Waals force approaches a constant, and is\nsimilar to a Brownian motion of a test particle in an thermal bath with an\neffective temperature.
