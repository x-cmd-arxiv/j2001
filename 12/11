The nature of this phenomenon is\nnot quite clear yet, but one of the possible explanations is that it is a\nmanifestation of the \"residual\" Hubble expansion, caused by some forms of an\nunclumped \"dark matter\" or \"dark energy\". If this is the case, a similar effect\nwill reveal itself also in operation of space-based interferometers with\nsufficiently long arms (10^7 km or greater, e.g., LISA and ASTROD) and,\ntherefore, should be taken into account in processing the data on\ngravitational-wave signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2001 02:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Special emphasis is put on its relation to the\nfluctuation of the chiral order parameter $<\\bar{q}q>$. In the vacuum, the\n$\\sigma$-meson is an elusive resonance corresponding to a pole deep in the\nsecond Riemann sheet of the $\\pi$-$\\pi$ scattering matrix in the $I$=$J$=0\nchannel.

The electron charge is\ndeduced from the theory, and it deviates by only one percent from its\nexperimental value. Two individual photon models are further investigated.\n  In the second theory by AK a Bivacuum model is a consequence of development\nof Dirac theory, pointing to equal probability of positive and negative energy.\nThe dynamic mechanism of [corpuscle (C) - wave (W)] duality is proposed. It\nunifies the extended relativity and QM. For details see:\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0003001. The theories of BL and AK reinforce each\nother, by having several points in common. There are the similarities with the\nDirac theory, symmetry with respect to the concepts of matter and antimatter,\nthe non-appearance of magnetic monopoles, a space- charge vacuum current in\naddition to the displacement current, models of the leptons having an internal\nvortex-like structure and force balance, photon models with a small but nonzero\nrest mass and a slightly reduced velocity of propagation, and particle-wave\nproperties, explaining self-interference even of single electrons or photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2001 14:51:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2002 11:52:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2002 14:25:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2002 10:41:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2004 12:39:08 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2004 19:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2005 14:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The starting point for a clarification of\nthis counterintuitive property is the observation that if one imposes the\nnatural and physically reasonable constraint that the mean energy is bounded\nfrom above, then the entropy of entanglement becomes a trace-norm continuous\nfunctional. The considerations will then be extended to the asymptotic limit,\nand we will prove some asymptotic continuity properties. We proceed by\ninvestigating the entanglement of formation and the relative entropy of\nentanglement in the infinite-dimensional setting. Finally, we show that the set\nof entangled states is still trace-norm dense in state space, even under the\nconstraint of a finite mean energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2001 15:34:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2001 16:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2002 18:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
