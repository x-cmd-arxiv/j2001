The native regular singularity of the equation is removed by applying a\nlinear transformation to the frame of reference. Two different approaches are\nused to carry out the solution. In the first approach the angular derivative is\ninterpreted in an original way that made it possible to discard this derivative\nfrom the equation for all black body media without upsetting the conservation\nof energy. In this approach the analytic solution is expressible in terms of\nexponential integrals without approximations but for practical considerations\nthe solution is presented in the form of Gauss-Legendre quadrature for\nquantitative evaluation of the solutions. In the second approach the angular\nderivative is approximated by a new set of discrete ordinates that guarantees\nthe closure of the set of equations and the conservation of energy. The\nsolutions from the two approaches are numerically identical in homogeneous and\nnon-homogeneous cold media as well as in local thermodynamic equilibrium and\nfor all optical depths that can be managed with 16 significant digits\narithmetics without numerical instabilities. The solution in either approach is\nmade possible by splitting the original transfer equation into two equations,\none for the centripetal energy flow and another one for the centrifugal energy\nflow. The end-points form of the solution proved to be very effective in\nnumerical computations without spatial truncation errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2001 17:17:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2001 06:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We argue that the LW3 luminosity measured in the cluster members is\na reliable tracer of the total infrared luminosity, L(IR). We derive from L(IR)\na star-formation rate free of dust extinction, SFR(IR), which we compare with\nthat determined in the optical from the flux of the [OII] emission line,\nSFR(opt).

We analyze a high resolution spectrum obtained in\n1999 October with the high energy transmission grating (HETG). From this\nspectrum we measure the strengths and an average profile of the observed X-ray\nlines. We also analyze a high signal-to-noise ratio CCD spectrum obtained in\n2000 December. The good statistics (~ 9250 counts) of this spectrum and the\nhigh spatial resolution provided by the telescope allow us to perform\nspectroscopic analyses of different regions of the remnant. We discuss the\nrelevant shock physics that can explain the observed X-ray emission. The X-ray\nspectra are well fit by plane parallel shock models with post-shock electron\ntemperatures of ~ 2.6 keV and ionization ages of ~ 6 x 10^10 cm^3/s. The\ncombined X-ray line profile has a FWHM of ~ 5000 km/s, indicating a blast wave\nspeed of ~ 3500 km/s. At this speed, plasma with a mean post-shock temperature\nof ~ 17 keV is produced. This is direct evidence for incomplete electron-ion\ntemperature equilibration behind the shock. Assuming this shock temperature, we\nconstrain the amount of collisionless electron heating at the shock front at\nT_e0 / T_s = 0.11 (+0.02,-0.01). We find that the plasma has low metallicity\n(abundances are ~ 0.1 -- 0.4 solar) and is nitrogen enriched (N/O ~ 0.8 by\nnumber), similar to that found for the equatorial ring.

The plasma is cooler near the optical Spot 1\n(at position angle ~ 30 degrees) and in the eastern half of the remnant, where\nthe bright optical spots are found, than in the western half, consistent with\nthe presence of slower (~ 500 km/s) shocks entering denser ring material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2001 23:52:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2002 18:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In analogy with the solidification cells\nformed in dilute binary alloys, colony formation is triggered by a\nmorphological instability of a macroscopically planar eutectic solidification\nfront due to the rejection by both solid phases of a ternary impurity that\ndiffuses in the liquid. Here we develop a phase-field model of a binary\neutectic with a dilute ternary impurity and we investigate by dynamical\nsimulations both the initial linear regime of this instability, and the\nsubsequent highly nonlinear evolution of the interface that leads to fully\ndeveloped two-phase cells with a spacing much larger than the lamellar spacing.\nWe find a good overall agreement with our recent linear stability analysis [M.\nPlapp and A.

We show\nthat, even though weak, this violation has an important quantitative effect on\nthe stability properties of the eutectic front.

A\nlinear and symmetric affine connection compatible with the family ${\\bf g}_t$\nis defined, giving rise to equations of motion.\n  Furthermore a quasi-metric theory of gravity, including field equations and\nlocal conservation laws, is presented. Just as for General Relativity, the\nfield equations accommodate two independent propagating dynamical degrees of\nfreedom. On the other hand, the particular structure of quasi-metric geometry\nallows only a partial coupling of space-time geometry to the active\nstress-energy tensor. Besides, the field equations are defined from projections\nof physical and geometrical tensors with respect to a \"preferred\" foliation of\nquasi-metric space-time into spatial hypersurfaces. Moreover, a number of\nnon-standard features make the field equations unsuitable for a standard\nPPN-analysis. This implies that the experimental status of the theory is not\ncompletely clear at this point in time. The theory seems to be consistent with\na number of cosmological observations and it satisfies all the classical solar\nsystem tests, though. Moreover, in its non-metric sector, the new theory has\nexperimental support where General Relativity fails or is irrelevant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2001 23:55:20 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 15:41:26 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 15:02:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2002 00:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 May 2002 17:22:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2003 23:20:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2004 22:50:56 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2005 23:58:55 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 04:54:08 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2018 10:55:21 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

In the\npresentation we give here, we restrict the study of the process on a regular\ngraph instead of the irregular graph used in LyoPem. The close connection\nbetween various problems on random walks in random environment and the so\ncalled multiplicative chaos martingale is underlined by showing that the\nclassification of the random walk problem can be drawn by the corresponding\nclassification for the multiplicative chaos, at least for those situations\nwhere both problems have been solved by independent methods. The chaos\ncounterpart of the problem we considered here has not yet been solved. The\nresults we obtain for the random walk problem localise the position of the\ncritical point. We conjecture that the additional conditions needed for the\nchaos problem to have non trivial solutions will be the same as the ones needed\nfor the random walk to be null recurrent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2001 16:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the second case one wishes to investigate the modifications of the\n$\\pi \\pi$ interaction in the nuclear medium in the region of the $\\sigma$\nmeson. In the first case we observe that it is quite difficult to see large\neffects due to the $\\rho$ modification in the medium because the detection of\nthe $\\rho $ is done through the two pions which are produced in the $\\Delta$\nregion and are largely distorted in the medium. In the second case, when the\nI=0 part of the $\\pi \\pi$ interaction is substituted by the in medium $\\pi \\pi$\namplitude, we observe a very large shift of strength in the invariant mass\ndistribution to small values of the mass in $^{12}C$ and $^{208}Pb$ with\nrespect to the distribution of the elementary reaction. This spectacular shift\nappears to be corroborated by recent experiments at Mainz reported in this same\nWorkshop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2001 14:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

An\nanalytic solution for this class of non-equilibrium models is developed by\nadopting well-known methods of nonlinear dynamics. Results are presented for\nthe CpG-methylation-deamination process which dominates point substitutions in\nvertebrates. The dinucleotide frequencies generated by the model (using\nempirically obtained mutation rates) match the overall pattern observed in\nnon-coding DNA. A web-based tool has been constructed to compute single- and\ndinucleotide frequencies for arbitrary neighbor-dependent mutation rates.\nAlsoprovided is the backward procedure to infer the mutation rates using\nmaximum likelihood analysis given the observed single- and dinucleotide\nfrequencies. Reasonable estimates of the mutation rates can be obtained very\nefficiently, using generic non-coding DNA sequences as input, after masking\noutlong homonucleotide subsequences. Our method is much more convenient and\nversatile to use than the traditional method of deducing mutation rates by\ncounting mutation events in carefully chosen sequences. More generally, our\napproach provides a more realistic but still tractable description of\nnon-coding genomic DNA, and may be used as a null model for various sequence\nanalysis applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2001 00:06:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2003 07:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
