Three of the galaxies were found to host both\npopulous clusters (M_V<-9.5 at a fiducial age of 10 Myr) and super-star\nclusters (M_V<-10.5 at 10 Myr). Four other dwarf galaxies, two of which contain\npopulous and super-star clusters, were drawn from the literature. We find upper\nlimits to integrated galactic M_B and star formation rate for the formation of\nthese clusters. However, galaxies brighter and more active than these limits\nrarely form them. Yet when they do form, the associated star formation activity\nis very high, with numerous compact clusters of similar age in the same complex\nand often evidence for a galaxy-wide perturbation as the trigger. This tendency\nto concentrate star formation in localized regions of high column density is\nconsistent with previous suggestions that self-gravity must be strong and the\npressure must be high to allow a cool phase of gas to exist in equilibrium.\nStatistical considerations emphasize the peculiarity of super-star clusters in\ndwarf galaxies, which are too small to sample the cluster mass function to that\nextreme. We suggest that triggered large-scale flows and ambient gravitational\ninstabilities in the absence of shear make the clouds that form super-star\nclusters in small galaxies. This is unlike the case in spirals where density\nwave flows and scale-free compression from turbulence dominate. Further compar-\nisons with spirals give insight into Larsen & Richtler's relation between star\nformation rate per unit area and the fraction of young stars in massive dense\nclusters. We suggest that this relation is the result of a physical connection\nbetween maximum cluster mass, interstellar pressure, column density, and star\nformation rate, combined with a size-of-sample effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2001 18:47:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

As pulse lag and luminosity have been found to be correlated this also\nrepresents a correlation between peak luminosity and jet-break time. Observed\ntimescales (variability or spectral lags) as well as peak luminosity naturally\nhave a strong dependence on the Lorentz factor of the outflow and so we propose\nthat much of the variety among GRBs has a purely kinematic origin (the speed or\ndirection of the outflow).\n  We explore a model in which the variation among GRBs is due to a variation in\njet-opening angles, and find that the narrowest jets have the fastest outflows.\nWe also explore models in which the jets have similar morphology and size, and\nthe variation among bursts is caused by variation in viewing angle and/or due\nto a velocity profile.

One expects\nto see high luminosities, short pulse lags and high variability as well as an\nearly jet-break time for bursts viewed on axis, while higher viewing\ninclinations will yield lower luminosities, longer pulse lags, smoother bursts\nand later jet-break times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2001 00:07:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2002 23:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

The average profile for type 1 AGN is still very\nbroad, with the red wing extending down to ~4 keV.

We consider a 5-dimensional \"brane\nuniverse\" where the visible and hidden sectors are localized on different\nbranes, and the standard model gauge bosons propagate in the bulk. In this\nframework there can be charged scalar messengers that have contact interactions\nwith the hidden sector, either localized in the hidden sector or in the bulk.\nThese scalars obtain soft masses that feed into visible sector scalar masses at\ntwo loop order via bulk gauge interactions. This contribution is automatically\nflavor-blind, and can be naturally positive. If the messengers are in the bulk\nthis contribution is automatically the same order of magnitude as the anomaly\nmediated contribution, independent of the brane spacing. If the messengers are\nlocalized to a brane the two effects are of the same order for relatively small\nbrane spacings. The gaugino masses and A terms are determined completely by\nanomaly mediation. In order for anomaly mediation to dominate over radion\nmediation the radion must be is stabilized in a manner that preserves\nsupersymmetry, with supergravity effects included. We show that this occurs in\nsimple models.

The reduction of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations to one dimension\nresults into systems of first order differential equations. In particular, the\nSpin(7)-invariant case gives rise to a 7-dimensional system which is completely\nintegrable. The different solutions are classified in terms of algebraic curves\nand are characterized by the genus of the associated Riemann surfaces.\nRemarkably, this system arises also in the construction of solutions in gauged\nsupergravities that have an interpretation as continuous distributions of\nbranes in string and M-theory. For the G_2 invariant case we perform two\ndistinct reductions, both giving rise to 6-dimensional systems. The first\nreduction, which is a complex generalization of the 3-dimensional Euler\nspinning top system, preserves an SU(2) X SU(2) X Z_2 symmetry and is fully\nintegrable in the particular case where an extra U(1) symmetry exists.

The models proposed\nfor the evaluation of the Lambda decay widths are summarized and their results\nare compared with the data. Despite the recent intensive investigations, the\nmain open problem remains a sound theoretical interpretation of the large\nexperimental values of the ratio G_n/G_p. Although recent works offer a step\nforward in the solution of the puzzle, further efforts must be invested in\norder to understand the detailed dynamics of the non-mesonic decay. Even if, by\nmeans of single nucleon spectra measurements, the error bars on G_n/G_p have\nbeen considerably reduced very recently at KEK, a clean extraction of G_n/G_p\nis needed. What is missing at present, but planned for the next future, are\nmeasurements of 1) nucleon energy spectra in double coincidence and 2) nucleon\nangular correlations: such observations allow to disentangle the nucleons\nproduced in one- and two-body induced decays and lead to a direct determination\nof G_n/G_p. For the asymmetric non-mesonic decay of polarized hypernuclei the\nsituation is even more puzzling. Indeed, strong inconsistencies appear already\namong data. A recent experiment obtained a positive intrinsic Lambda asymmetry\nparameter, a_{Lambda}, for 5_{Lambda}He. This is in complete disagreement with\na previous measurement, which obtained a large and negative a_{Lambda} for\np-shell hypernuclei, and with theory, which predicts a negative value\nmoderately dependent on nuclear structure effects. Also in this case, improved\nexperiments establishing with certainty the sign and magnitude of a_{Lambda}\nfor s- and p-shell hypernuclei will provide a guidance for a deeper\nunderstanding of hypernuclear dynamics and decay mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2001 18:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

To do this, we derive new light-front\nnucleon-nucleon one- and two-meson-exchange potentials, and use the potentials\nto solve for the deuteron wave function and binding energy. We find that\nincluding two-meson-exchange (TME) potentials partially repairs the broken\nrotational invariance of the one-meson-exchange (OME) potential. This is shown\nby a decrease in binding energy difference of different $m$ states of the\ndeuteron. We calculate the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current using\nthe deuteron wave functions obtained from the OME and OME+TME potentials.\nRotational invariance requires that the matrix elements satisfy an angular\ncondition, but in light-front dynamics that condition is only partially\nsatisfied. The current matrix elements from the OME calculation satisfy the\nangular condition better than the ones from the OME+TME calculation. The matrix\nelements of the axial current satisfy the angular condition to the same extent\nregardless of which wave functions are used for the calculation. Finally, we\nfind that at momentum transfers greater than about 2 GeV$^2$, the breaking of\nrotational invariance causes less uncertainty in the computed deuteron form\nfactors than do the uncertainties in the nucleon form factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2001 22:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

However, application of this method to low energy\nor very high quality beams is limited by scattering in the front foil of the\ninterferometer. To overcome this limitation we propose to use a perforated\nfront foil. For the beam energy and hole sizes we are considering, the\nunscattered beam electrons passing through the holes will produce diffraction\nradiation (ODR). The total radiation produced from the first and second foils\nthen will be a spatially coherent sum of ODR and OTR from unscattered and\nscattered electrons. By controlling the number and size of the perforations,\nthe inter-foil spacing, the thickness of the first foil and the wavelength and\nband pass of the observed radiation, the coherent interferences due to the\nunscattered portion of the beam can be isolated and observed. The visibility of\nthese interferences can then be used to determine the rms beam divergence. We\nhave developed a general computer code which can be used to calculate\ndiffraction radiation from any type of perforation and another code to compute\nthe ODR-OTR interference pattern for a given set of beam and optical\nparameters. These codes are employed in the design of an interferometer to\nmeasure the divergence of the ATF accelerator operating at 30 MeV. This beam\nwill be used in an initial proof of principle experiment for the ODR-OTR\ninterferometer. We present the results of our code calculations which show that\nthe expected divergence, 200 micro radians, can be easily measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2001 20:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
