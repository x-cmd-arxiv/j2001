We\nrevisit the theory of weak brane gravity using gauge-invariant gravitational\nand scalar perturbations around a background warped geometry with a bulk scalar\nbetween two flat branes. We obtain a simple condition for the radion\nstabilization in terms of the scalar field potentials. We show that for general\npotentials of the scalar field which provides radion stabilization and a\ngeneral conformal transformation to a frame in which matter on the branes are\nminimally coupled to the metric, 4-dimensional Einstein gravity, not BD\ngravity, is restored at low energies on either brane. In contrast, in RS brane\nworld scenario without a bulk scalar, low energy gravity is BD one. We\nconjecture that in general brane world scenarios with more than one scalar\nfield, one will again encounter the situation that low energy gravity is not\ndescribed by the Einstein theory. Equipped with the weak gravity results, we\ndiscuss the properties of 4d brane gravitational equations, in particular, the\nvalue and sign of 4d Newton's gravitational coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2001 18:30:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2002 14:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is argued that on contrast to the quantum computing the problem\nof the use of exponential resources as the payment for the absense of\nentanglement does not exist for quantum neural processing. This is because of\ncorresponding systems, as any modern classical artificial neural systems, do\nnot realize functions precisely, but approximate them by training on small sets\nof examples. It can permit to implement quantum neural systems optically,\nbecause in this case there is no need in exponential resources of optical\ndevices (beam-splitters etc.). On the other hand, the role of entanglement in\nquantum neural processing is still very important, because it actually\nassociates qubit states: this is necessary feature of quantum neural memory\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2001 07:02:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2001 11:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
