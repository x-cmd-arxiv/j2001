We explore this\nhypothesis with hydrodynamic simulations of flares occurring in a non-confined\ncorona: model flares are triggered by a transient impulsive heating injected in\na plane-parallel stratified corona. The plasma evolution is described by means\nof a numerical 2-D model in cylindrical geometry R,Z. We explore the space of\nfundamental parameters. As a reference model, we consider a flare triggered by\na heating pulse that would cause a 20 MK flare if delivered in a 40000 km long\nclosed loop. The modeled plasma evolution is described. The X-ray emission,\nspectra and light curves at the ASCA/SIS focal plan, and in two intense X-ray\nlines (Mg XI at 9.169 A and Fe XXI at 128.752 A), have been synthesized from\nthe models. The results are discussed and compared to features of confined\nevents, and scaling laws are derived. The light curves invariably show a very\nrapid rise, a constant phase as long as the constant heating is on, and then a\nvery fast decay, on time scales of few seconds, followed by a more gradual one\n(few minutes). We show that this evolution of the emission, and especially the\nfast decay, together with other potentially observable effects, are intrinsic\nto the assumption of non-confinement. Their lack indicates that observed\nlong-lasting stellar X-ray flares should involve plasma strongly confined by\nmagnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2001 17:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Recently another subclass of outbursts in such binaries has\nbeen discovered, which are an order of magnitude fainter and last shorter than\ntypical hours to days. We discuss whether they constitute a separate subset of\nx-ray binaries.\n  A second class of x-ray transients are the x-ray bursts. Thermonuclear\nexplosions on a neutron star (type I x-ray bursts) usually last of order\nminutes or less. We discovered a second type (called super x-ray bursts) with a\nduration of several hours. They relate to thermonuclear detonations much deeper\nin the neutron star atmosphere, possibly burning on the nuclear ashes of normal\nx-ray bursts.\n  The third class are the enigmatic Fast X-ray Transients occurring at all\ngalactic latitudes. We found that the bright ones are of two types only: either\nnearby coronal sources (lasting hours) or the socalled x-ray flashes (lasting\nminutes). The new class, the X-ray flashes, may be a new type of cosmic\nexplosion, intermediate between supernovae and gamma ray bursts, or they may be\nhighly redshifted gamma ray bursts.\n  It thus appears that the three classes of x-ray transients each come in two\nflavors: long and short.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2001 16:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We also show that this\nprescription does not reproduce the exact result for a sharp transition. Then,\nmore generally, we demonstrate that, in the only case where a bounce can be\nobtained in Einstein General Relativity without facing singularities and/or\nviolation of the standard energy conditions, the bounce cannot be made\narbitrarily short. This contrasts with the standard (inflationary) situation\nwhere the transition between two eras with different values of the equation of\nstate can be considered as instantaneous. We then argue that the usually\nconserved quantities are not constant on a typical bounce time scale. Finally,\nwe also examine the case of a test scalar field (or gravitational waves) where\nsimilar results are obtained.

The exponential scaling of the\nyield ratios with the third component of the fragment isospin (N-Z)/2 is\nobserved in all reactions, with scaling parameters that depend on the incident\nenergy. Breakup temperatures for these reactions are deduced from double ratios\nof isotopic yields and tested for their relation with the isoscaling\nparameters. The quantum statistical (QSM) and the statistical\nmultifragmentation (SMM) models are used for interpreting the results. The\nobserved isoscaling can be understood as a consequence of a statistical origin\nof the emitted fragments in these reactions. The SMM analysis shows that the\nexponent describing the isoscaling behavior is proportional to the strength of\nthe symmetry term of the fragment binding energy. Using this result, a\nsymmetry-term coefficient (approximately 22.5 MeV) for fragments at breakup is\ndeduced from the experimental data.
