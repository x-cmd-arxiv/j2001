As a phenomenon distinct from the enduring electrophonic sounds\nthat occasionally accompany the passage and ablation of large meteoroids in the\nEarth's lower atmosphere, the bursters have proved stubbornly difficult to\nexplain. A straightforward calculation demonstrates that in contradistinction\nto the enduring electrophonic sounds, the electrophonic bursters are not\ngenerated as a consequence of interactions between the meteoroid ablation\nplasma and the Earth's geomagnetic field.
