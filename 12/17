This\nevent was the first gamma ray burst (GRB) localized by HETE-2 which has\nresulted in the detection of an optical afterglow. In this paper we report the\nearliest known observations of the GRB010921 field, taken with the 0.11-m\nLivermore Optical Transient Imaging System (LOTIS) telescope, and the earliest\nknown detection of the GRB010921 optical afterglow, using the 0.5-m Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey Photometric Telescope (SDSS PT). Observations with the LOTIS\ntelescope began during a routine sky patrol 52 minutes after the burst.\nObservations were made with the SDSS PT, the 0.6-m Super-LOTIS telescope, and\nthe 1.34-m Tautenburg Schmidt telescope at 21.3, 21.8, and 37.5 hours after the\nGRB, respectively. In addition, the host galaxy was observed with the USNOFS\n1.0-m telescope 56 days after the burst. We find that at later times (t > 1 day\nafter the burst), the optical afterglow exhibited a power-law decline with a\nslope of $\\alpha = 1.75 \\pm 0.28$. However, our earliest observations show that\nthis power-law decline can not have extended to early times (t < 0.035 day).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2001 15:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We discuss two competing transport channels for Cooper pairs\nto tunnel from the SC into the LL leads.

Splitting the total, genuine\nelectromagnetic field into the sum of a conventional field and a zero point\nfield is physically meaningless. If a receiver attenuates the genuine field\ndown to a zero conventional field, it remains a zero point field having the\ncoherence and the phase of the conventional field, and vice-versa for the\namplification of the zero point field by a source.\n  Nonlinear optical effects must be written using the genuine field, so that at\nlow light levels they become linear in relation to the conventional field. The\nresult of the interpretation of all observations, even at low light levels, is\nexactly the same in quantum electrodynamics and in the semi-classical theory.\n  The zero point field is stochastic only far from the sources and the\nreceivers; elsewhere, it is shaped by matter, it may be studied through fields\nvisible before an absorption or after an amplification.\n  Two examples are given : the computation of fourth order interferences and\nthe use of the impulsive stimulated Raman scattering with ordinary incoherent\nlight in astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2001 08:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
