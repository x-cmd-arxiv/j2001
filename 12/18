We use a simplified description for\nthe evolution of the cataclysmic binary and focus on cases where the\ncircumbinary disk causes accelerated mass transfer (> 1e-8 Msun/yr). The inner\nedge of the disk is assumed to be determined by the tidal truncation radius and\nthe mass input rate into the disk is assumed to be a small fraction (1e-5-0.01)\nof the mass transfer rate. Under the action of the viscous stresses in the disk\nthe matter drifts outward with the optically thick region extending to several\nAU. The inner part of the disk is cool with maximum effective temperatures <\n3,000 K while the outermost parts of the disk are < 30 K and optically thin. We\ncalculate the effects of thermal instability on a sufficiently massive CB disk.\nIt leads to outbursts reminiscent of those in thermally unstable accretion\ndisks, with the instability remaining confined to the inner regions of the CB\ndisk. However, for most of the evolutionary sequences the surface densities\nrequired to trigger instability are not reached. The spectral energy\ndistributions from circumbinary disks are calculated, and the prospects for the\ndetection of such disks in the infrared and submm wavelength regions are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2001 20:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

These\ninvisible electrons produce Faraday rotation and conversion, leaving their\nfootprints in the linear and circular polarized radiation of the source. An\nimportant factor is also the magnetic field structure, which can be\ncharacterized in most cases by a global magnetic field and a turbulent\ncomponent. We present the basic radiative transfer coefficients for polarized\nsynchrotron radiation and apply them to the standard jet model for relativistic\nradio jets. The model can successfully explain the unusual circular and linear\npolarization of the Galactic Centre radio source Sgr A* and its sibling M81*.\nIt also can account for the circular polarization found in jets of more\nluminous quasars and X-ray binaries. The high ratio of circular to linear\npolarization requires the presence of a significant fraction of hidden matter\nand low-energy electrons in these jets. The stable handedness of circular\npolarization requires stable global magnetic field components with\nnon-vanishing magnetic flux along the jet, while the low degree of total\npolarization implies also a significant turbulent field. The most favoured\nmagnetic field configuration is that of a helix, while a purely toroidal field\nis unable to produce significant circular polarization. If connected to the\nmagnetosphere of the black hole, the circular polarization and the jet\ndirection determine the magnetic poles of the system which is stable over long\nperiods of time. This may also have implications for possible magnetic field\nconfigurations in accretion flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2001 16:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

We show that an application of what we know of AGN\nSpectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) and the IR background requires that a\nsignificant fraction of the 10-150 micron background comes from AGNs. This\nconclusion can only be avoided if obscured AGNs are intrinsically brighter in\nthe X-rays (with respect to the optical-UV) than unobscured AGNs, contrary to\n``unified schemes'' for AGNs, or have a dust to gas ratio much lower (< 0.1)\nthan Galactic.

Subsequently, it\nhas been argued that the intergalactic plasma may interfere adversely with this\nmechanism by rendering the oscillations energy dependent. Here we show that\nthis energy dependence is extremely sensitive to the precise value of the free\nelectron density in the Universe. Decreasing the electron density by only a\nfactor of 4 is already sufficient to bring the energy dependence within the\nexperimental bounds. Models of the intergalactic medium show that for redshifts\nz<1 about 97% of the total volume of space is filled with regions of density\nsignificantly lower than the average density. From these models we estimate\nthat the average electron density in most of space is lower by at least a\nfactor of 15 compared to the estimate based on one half of all baryons being\nuniformly distributed and ionized. Therefore the energy dependence of the\nphoton-axion oscillations is consistent with experiment, and the oscillation\nmodel remains a viable alternative to the accelerating Universe for explaining\nthe supernova observations. Furthermore, the electron density does give rise to\na sufficiently large plasma frequency which cuts off the photon-axion mixing\nabove microwave frequencies, shielding the cosmic microwave photons from axion\nconversions and significantly relaxing the lower bounds on the axion mass\nimplied by the oscillation model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2001 20:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

This breaking can be\nachieved in various ways: by slight relative rotations of the branes with small\nangles, by considering small relative velocities between the branes, etc. If\nthe breaking parameter is sufficiently small, a large number of e-folds can be\nproduced within the D-brane, for small changes of the configuration in the\ncompactified directions. Such a process is local, i.e. it does not depend very\nstrongly on the compactification space nor on the initial conditions. Moreover,\nthe breaking induces a very small velocity and acceleration, which ensures very\nsmall slow-roll parameters and thus an almost scale invariant spectrum of\nmetric fluctuations, responsible for the observed temperature anisotropies in\nthe microwave background. Inflation ends as in hybrid inflation, triggered by\nthe negative curvature of the string tachyon potential.

We use the generalized Skyrme interaction SkO' to describe\neven-even ground states and then analyze the effects of time-odd spin-isospin\ncouplings, first term by term and then together via linear regression. Some\nterms affect the strength and energy of the Gamow-Teller resonance in finite\nnuclei without altering the Landau parameter g_0' that to leading order\ndetermines spin-isospin properties of nuclear matter. Though the existing data\nare not sufficient to uniquely determine all the spin-isospin couplings, we are\nable to fit them locally. Altering these coupling constants does not change the\nquality with which the Skyrme functional describes rotational bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2001 22:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
