Also in\nthe case of (supposedly single) OB-runaway stars, only a minority appears to be\nassociated with a bow-shock (Van Buren et al. 1995). We investigate why wind\nbow-shocks are not detected for the majority of these OB-runaway systems: is\nthis due to the IRAS sensitivity, the system's space velocity, the stellar-wind\nproperties, or the height above the galactic plane? It turns out that none of\nthese suggested causes can explain the low detection rate (~40%). We propose\nthat the conditions of the interstellar medium mainly determine whether a wind\nbow-shock is formed or not. In hot, tenuous media (like inside galactic\nsuperbubbles) the sound speed is high (~100 km/s), such that many runaways move\nat subsonic velocity through a low-density medium, thus preventing the\nformation of an observable bow-shock. Superbubbles are expected (and observed)\naround OB associations, where the OB-runaway stars were once born.

Although\nthese vertical resonances are weaker than the corresponding Lindblad\nresonances, the m=2 inner vertical resonance in a binary star is typically\nlocated within the tidal truncation radius of a circumstellar disc.\n  In this paper I develop a general theory of vertical resonances, allowing for\nnon-linearity of the response, and dissipation by radiative damping and\nturbulent viscosity. The problem is reduced to a universal, non-linear ordinary\ndifferential equation with two real parameters. Solutions of the complex\nnon-linear Airy equation are presented to illustrate the non-linear saturation\nof the resonance and the effects of dissipation. It is argued that the m=2\ninner vertical resonance is unlikely to truncate the disc in cataclysmic\nvariable stars, but contributes to angular momentum transport and produces a\npotentially observable non-axisymmetric structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2001 10:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

In particular, we compare\nthe model results to the galaxy IZw18, which is a very metal-poor, gas-rich\ndwarf galaxy, possibly experiencing its first or second burst of star\nformation. We follow the evolution of a first weak burst of star formation\nfollowed by a second more intense one occurring after several hundreds million\nyears. We find that a galactic wind develops only during the second burst and\nthat metals produced in the burst are preferentially lost relative to the\nhydrogen gas. We predict the evolution of several chemical abundances (H, He,\nC, N, O, \\alpha-elements, Fe) in the gas inside and outside the galaxy, by\ntaking into account in detail the chemical and energetical contributions from\ntype II and Ia supernovae. We find that the abundances predicted for the star\nforming region are in good agreement with the HII region abundances derived for\nIZw18.

We conclude that IZw18\nmust have experienced two bursts of star formation, one occurred \\sim 300 Myr\nago and a present one with an age between 4-7 Myr. However, by taking into\naccount also other independent estimates, such as the color-magnitude diagram\nand the spectral energy distribution of stars in IZw18, and the fact that real\nstarbursts are not instantaneous, we suggest that it is more likely that the\nburst age is between 4 and 15 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2001 15:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

These sources are thought to be\naccreting at low rates and advection (or convection) dominated accretion flows\nare usually considered the best candidates to explain them. Here we present an\nalternative possibility, involving strong, unbound, magnetic coronae generated\nby geometrically thin, optically thick accretion discs at low accretion rates.\nFirst we show that, if angular momentum transport in the disc is due to\nmagnetic turbulent stresses, the magnetic energy density and effective viscous\nstresses inside the disc are proportional to the geometric mean of the total\n(gas plus radiation) and gas pressure. Therefore the corona is less powerful in\na radiation pressure dominated disc, and the relative fraction of the power\nliberated in the corona increases as the accretion rate decreases. Furthermore,\nwe discuss reasons why energetically dominant coronae are ideal sites for\nlaunching powerful jets/outflows, both MHD and thermally driven. In analysing\nthe spectral properties of such coronal outflow dominated accretion discs, we\nreach the important conclusion that if the jet/outflow is, as is likely,\nradiatively inefficient, then so is the source overall, even without advection\nof energy into the black hole being relevant for the dynamics of the accretion\nflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2001 15:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

A new infinite set of mutually commuting charges\nis found which, unlike those from the Dolan-Grady set, include the terms\nquadratic in the Onsager algebra generators. This allows us to find the general\nform of the superalgebra of $n$-HSUSY and fix it explicitly for the cases of\n$n=2,3,4,5,6$. The similar results are obtained for a new, contracted form of\nthe Onsager algebra generated via the contracted Dolan-Grady relations. As an\napplication, the algebraic structure of the known 1D and 2D systems with\n$n$-HSUSY is clarified and a generalization of the construction to the case of\nnonlinear pseudo-supersymmetry is proposed. Such a generalization is discussed\nin application to some integrable spin models and with its help we obtain a\nfamily of quasi-exactly solvable systems appearing in the $PT$-symmetric\nquantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2001 17:17:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2001 23:08:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2002 23:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
