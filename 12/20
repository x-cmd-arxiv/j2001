An ADAF with strong winds\n(ADIOS) model is not favored if we assume that the wind does not radiate.\nAlternatively, we propose a coupled jet plus accretion disk model to explain\nthe observations for Sgr A$^*$. The accretion flow is described as an ADAF fed\nby Bondi-Hoyle accretion of hot plasma in the Galactic Center region. A small\nfraction of the accretion flow is ejected near the black hole, forming a jet\nafter passing through a shock. As a result, the electron temperature increases\nto $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{11}{\\rm K}$, which is about 10 times higher than the\nhighest temperature attained in the ADAF. The model is self-consistent since\nthe main jet parameters are determined by the underlying accretion disk at the\ninner edge. The emergent spectrum of Sgr A$^*$ is the sum of the emission from\njet and underlying ADAF. The very strong Comptonization of synchrotron emission\nfrom the jet dominates the bremsstrahlung from the ADAF, therefore, a very\nshort variability timescale is expected and the predicted X-ray slope and the\nradio spectrum is in very good agreement with the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2001 20:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Because of the luminosity segregation, the LF of the AC118\nshows a larger number of bright galaxies per unit dwarf in the core than in\nother cluster locations.

A counter example to the\noriginal formulation of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis and Affleck is exhibited and a more\nprecise statement is formulated. The degeneracy of the ground-state in symmetry\nbreaking phases with long-range order is analyzed. The second and third parts\nof the paper concern resonating valence-bond (RVB) spin liquids. In these\nphases the relationship between various authors approaches: Laughlin-Oshikawa,\nSutherland, Rokhsar and Kivelson, Read and Chakraborty and the\nLieb-Schultz-Mattis-Affleck proposal is studied. The deep physical relation\nbetween the degeneracy property and the absence of stiffness is explained and\nillustrated numerically. A new conjecture is formed concerning the absolute\nabsence of sensitivity of the spin liquid ground-states to any twist of the\nboundary conditions (thermodynamic limit). In the third part of the paper the\nrelations between the quantum numbers of the degenerate multiplets of the spin\nliquid phases are obtained exactly. Their relationship with a topological\nproperty of the wave functions of the low lying levels of this spin liquid\nphase is emphasized. In spite of the degeneracy of the ground-state, we explain\nwhy these phases cannot exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2001 17:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

With n \\ge 4 extra\ndimensions, current bounds on deeply penetrating showers from AGASA already\nprovide the most stringent bound on low-scale gravity, requiring a fundamental\nPlanck scale M_D > 1.3 - 1.8 TeV. The Auger Observatory will probe M_D as large\nas 4 TeV and may observe on the order of a hundred black holes in 5 years. We\nalso consider the implications of angular momentum and possible exponentially\nsuppressed parton cross sections; including these effects, large black hole\nrates are still possible. Finally, we demonstrate that even if only a few black\nhole events are observed, a standard model interpretation may be excluded by\ncomparison with Earth-skimming neutrino rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2001 20:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2002 22:06:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2002 23:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-10"}

These equations are similar to those for the time\ndependence of the scale factor and a scalar field in 4d cosmology, but with the\nsign of the scalar field potential reversed. Based on this analogy, we\nintroduce novel methods for studying the warped geometry. We construct the full\nphase portraits of the warp factor/scalar system for several examples of the\nbulk potential. This allows us to view the global properties of the warped\ngeometry. For flat branes, the phase portrait is two dimensional. Moving along\ntypical phase trajectories, the warp factor is initially increasing and finally\ndecreasing. All trajectories have timelike gradient-dominated singularities at\none or both of their ends, which are reachable in a finite distance and must be\nscreened by the branes. For curved branes, the phase portrait is three\ndimensional. However, as the warp factor increases the phase trajectories tend\ntowards the two dimensional surface corresponding to flat branes. We discuss\nthis property as a mechanism that may stretch the curved brane to be almost\nflat, with a small cosmological constant. Finally, we describe the embedding of\nbranes in the 5d bulk using the phase space geometric methods developed here.\nIn this language the boundary conditions at the branes can be described as a 1d\ncurve in the phase space.

The new fuels possess a ew chemical structure\nfirst identified by one of us (R.M.S.), which is characterized by clusters of\nordinary molecules and atoms under a new bond of electromagnetic nature. These\nclusters constitute a new chemical species different than the conventional\nmolecules, since they are stable at ordinary conditions while exhibiting no\ninfrared signature (other than those of conventional molecular constituents),\nthus confirming that the bond is not of valence type. For this reason the new\nchemical species is called ''Santilli's electromagnecules'' or ''magnecules''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2001 08:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\n\"commercial efficiency\" is defined as the ratio between the total energy output\n(energy in magnegas plus heat) and the electric energy used for its production,\nwhile the \"scientific efficiency\" is the usual ratio between the total energy\noutput and the total energy input (the sum of the electric energy plus the\nenergy in the liquid feedstock as well as that in the carbon electrodes). A\nprimary purpose of this paper is to show that conventional thermochemistry does\nindeed predict a commercial efficiency bigger than one, although their values\nis considerably smaller than the actual efficiency measured in the reactors,\nthus indicating the applicability of the covering hadronic chemistry from which\nthe reactors have received their name. We reach an upper limit of the\ncommercial efficiency of 3.11 for the use of pure water as feedstock, and of\n3.11 to 7.5 for a mixture of ethyleneglicole and water. The study of the heat\nproduced by the reactions leads to large divergencies between the\nthermochemical predictions and experimental data of at least a factor of three.\nSuch divergencies can only be explained with deviations from quantum chemistry\nin favor of the covering hadronic chemistry. In particular, the indicated large\ndivergencies can only be explained with the assumption that the produced\ncombustible gas has the new non-valence chemical structure of Santilli\nmagnecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2001 09:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The timeless formulation\nof quantum mechanics follows from the underlying theory when the mass of the\nparticle is much smaller than Planck mass.
