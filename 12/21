The\nmethod is semi-parametric since it uses minimal assumptions about cluster\nproperties in order to minimize possible biases. No assumptions are made about\nthe shape of clusters, their radial profile or their luminosity function. The\nmethod is successful in finding systems ranging from poor to rich clusters of\ngalaxies, of both regular and irregular shape. We determine the selection\nfunction of the CE method via extensive Monte Carlo simulations which use both\nthe real, observed background of galaxies and a randomized background of\ngalaxies. We use position shuffled and color shuffled data to perform the false\npositive test. We have also visually checked all the clusters detected by the\nCE method. We apply the CE method to the 350 deg^2 of the SDSS (Sloan Digital\nSky Survey) commissioning data and construct a SDSS CE galaxy cluster catalog\nwith an estimated redshift and richness for each cluster.

Molecules including CO and CS almost vanish near the core centers,\nwhere the abundance decreases by one or two orders of magnitude. At the same\ntime, N2H+ has a constant abundance, and the fraction of NH3 increases toward\nthe core center. Our conclusions are based on a study of 5 mostly-round\nstarless cores (L1498, L1495, L1400K, L1517B, and L1544), which we have\nmappedin C18O(1-0), C17O(1-0), CS(2-1), C34S(2-1), N2H+(1-0), NH3(1,1) and\n(2,2), and the 1.2 mm continuum. For each core we have built a model that fits\nsimultaneously the radial profile of all observed emission and the central\nspectrum for the molecular lines. The observed abundance drops of CO and CS are\nnaturally explained by the depletion of these molecules onto dust grains at\ndensities of 2-6 10^4 cm-3. N2H+ seems unaffected by this process up to\ndensities of several 10^5, while the NH3 abundance may be enhanced by reactions\ntriggered by the disappearance of CO from the gas phase. With the help of our\nmodels, we show that chemical differentiation automatically explains the\ndiscrepancy between the sizes of CS and NH3 maps, a problem which has remained\nunexplained for more than a decade. Our models, in addition, show that a\ncombination of radiative transfer effects can give rise to the previously\nobserved discrepancy in the linewidth of these two tracers. Although this\ndiscrepancy has been traditionally interpreted as resulting from a systematic\nincrease of the turbulent linewidth with radius, our models show that it can\narise in conditions of constant gas turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2001 17:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In the presence of magnetic field, the\nspin precesses and the tunnel current is modulated at the Larmor frequency. The\nmechanism relies on the effective spin-orbit interaction between the injected\nunpolarized STM current and the local spin center, which leads to the nodal\nstructure of the spatial signal profile. Based on the proposed mechanism, the\nstrongest spin-related signal can be expected for the systems with large\nspin-orbit coupling and low carrier concentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2001 00:44:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2002 21:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The same result\nis extended in the case of an approximate cloning oracle, thus establishing\nthat $NP \\subseteq BPP^C \\subseteq BQP^C$ and $NP \\subseteq BPP^{AC} \\subseteq\nBQP^{AC}$, where C and AC are the exact and approximate cloning oracles,\nrespectively. Although exact cloning is impossible in quantum systems,\napproximate cloning remains a possibility. However, the best known methods for\napproximate cloning (based on unitary evolution) do not currently achieve the\ndesired precision levels. And it remains an open question whether they could be\nimproved when non-linear (or non-unitary) operators are used. Finally, a\nstraightforward attempt to dispense with cloning, replacing it by unitary\nevolution, is proved to be impossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2001 12:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
