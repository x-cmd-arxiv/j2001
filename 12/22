To accomplish this, we encode the original\nstate by distributing quantum information over six qubits which is the minimal\nnumber for the present task (see reference [1]). The encoding and error\nrecovery operations for such a code are presented. It is noted that the present\ncode is also a three-qubit quantum hidded information code over each qubit. In\naddition, an encoding scheme for hiding $n$-qubit quantum information over each\nqubit is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2001 21:56:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2002 05:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We are interested in which, if either, of these descriptions of\n$\\rho_{ss}$, is more natural. In the preceding paper we concentrated upon\nwhether descriptions such as these are physically realizable (PR). In this\npaper we investigate another relevant aspect of these ensembles, their\nrobustness. A robust ensemble is one for which the pure states that comprise it\nsurvive relatively unchanged for a long time under the system evolution. We\ndetermine numerically the most robust ensembles as a function of the parameters\nin the laser model: the self-energy $\\chi$ of the bosons in the laser mode, and\nthe excess phase noise $\\nu$. We find that these most robust ensembles are PR\nensembles, or similar to PR ensembles, for all values of these parameters. In\nthe ideal laser limit ($\\nu=\\chi=0$), the most robust states are coherent\nstates. As the phase noise $\\nu$ or phase dispersion $\\chi$ is increased, the\nmost robust states become increasingly amplitude-squeezed. We find scaling laws\nfor these states. As the phase diffusion or dispersion becomes so large that\nthe laser output is no longer quantum coherent, the most robust states become\nso squeezed that they cease to have a well-defined coherent amplitude. That is,\nthe quantum coherence of the laser output is manifest in the most robust PR\nstates having a well-defined coherent amplitude. This lends support to the idea\nthat robust PR ensembles are the most natural description of the state of the\nlaser mode. It also has interesting implications for atom lasers in particular,\nfor which phase dispersion due to self-interactions is expected to be large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2001 07:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
