This 'signal-locality theorem'\ngeneralises yet another feature of the pilot-wave theory of de Broglie and\nBohm, for which it is already known that signal-locality is true only in\nequilibrium. Assuming certain symmetries, lower bounds are derived on the\n'degree of nonlocality' of the singlet state, defined as the (equilibrium)\nfraction of outcomes at one wing of an EPR-experiment that change in response\nto a shift in the distant angular setting. It is shown by explicit calculation\nthat these bounds are satisfied by pilot-wave theory. The degree of nonlocality\nis interpreted as the average number of bits of 'subquantum information'\ntransmitted superluminally, for an equilibrium ensemble. It is proposed that\nthis quantity might provide a novel measure of the entanglement of a quantum\nstate, and that the field of quantum information would benefit from a more\nexplicit hidden-variables approach. It is argued that the signal-locality\ntheorem supports the hypothesis, made elsewhere, that in the remote past the\nuniverse relaxed to a state of statistical equilibrium at the hidden-variable\nlevel, a state in which nonlocality happens to be masked by quantum noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2001 13:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
