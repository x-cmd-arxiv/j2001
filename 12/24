Helical primordial magnetic fields, expected from cosmic events such as\nelectroweak baryogenesis, can lead to helical velocity flows and hence to\nnon-vanishing correlations of the temperature and B-type polarization. However\nwe show that the magnitude of the induced helical flow is unobservably small\nbecause the helical component of a magnetic field is almost force-free. We\ndiscuss an alternate scheme for extracting the helicity of a stochastically\nhomogeneous and isotropic primordial magnetic field using observations of the\nCMBR. The scheme involves constructing Faraday rotation measure maps of the\nCMBR and thus determining the sum of the helical and non-helical components of\nthe primordial magnetic field. The power spectrum of B-type polarization\nfluctuations, on the other hand, are sensitive only to the non-helical\ncomponent of the primordial magnetic field. The primordial magnetic helicity\ncan then be derived by combining these two sets of observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2001 18:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

About 1200\nflux measurements from 96 objects have been collected from the literature, from\nunpublished observations, from the HST archive, or from new narrow-band filter\nimaging. For most objects, the distance and reddening is known (or newly\ndetermined), and luminosities were calculated from the observed fluxes. The\nluminosity data were combined in five groups, according to nova light curve\ntype (very fast, fast, moderately fast, slow, recurrent); some objects were\nre-assigned to other groups for a better fit of the luminosity data to the\ngeneral trend. For very fast, fast and moderately fast novae, the slope of the\n[O III] decline is very similar, leading to a basic `switchoff' of [O III]\nemission after 11, 23 and 24 years, respectively. For the same speed classes,\nthe slope of the Balmer luminosity is quite similar. In contrast to all types\nof fast novae, the decline in Balmer luminosity is more rapid in slow novae.\nHowever, the slope in [O III] is more gentle; slow novae still show [O III]\nemission after 100 years. Thus shells of slow novae are still hot after one\ncentury; the same applies for the shells of the very fast nova GK Per and the\nrecurrent nova T Pyx, which interact with circumstellar material.In recurrent\nnovae, [O III] is usually inconspicuous or absent. In objects with giant\ncompanions, the Balmer luminosity decreases very slowly after an outburst,\nwhich may be an effect of line blending of material from the ejecta and the\ngiant wind. On the other hand, objects with dwarf companions show a very rapid\ndecline in Balmer luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2001 14:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
