After core\nhydrogen exhaustion, the star expands, loses most of its envelope by Roche lobe\noverflow, and becomes a Wolf-Rayet star. We study its post-mass transfer\nevolution as a function of the Wolf-Rayet wind mass loss rate (which is\ncurrently not well constrained and will probably vary with initial metallicity\nof the star). Varying this mass loss rate by a factor 6 leads to stellar masses\nat collapse that range from 3.1 to 10.7 solar masses. Although the iron core\nmasses at collapse are generally larger for stars with larger final masses,\nthey do not depend monotonically on the final stellar mass or even the C/O-core\nmass. We then compute the evolution of all models through collapse and bounce.\nThe results range from strong supernova explosions for the lower final masses\nto the direct collapse of the star into a black hole for the largest final\nmass. Correspondingly, the final remnant masses, which were computed by\nfollowing the supernova evolution and fallback of material for a time scale of\nabout one year, are between 1.2 and 10 solar masses. We discuss the remaining\nuncertainties of this result and outline the consequences of our results for\nthe understanding of the progenitor evolution of X-ray binaries and gamma-ray\nburst models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2001 19:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Generally, this charge is\nlocally fractionalized in units of 1/N for gauge group SU(N), but globally\nquantized in integral units. We show explicitly that in d=4 global topological\ncharge is a linkage number of the closed two-surface of a center vortex with a\nnexus world line, and relate this linkage to the Hopf fibration, with homotopy\n$\\Pi_3(S^3)\\simeq Z$; this homotopy insures integrality of the global\ntopological charge. We show that a standard nexus form used earlier, when\nlinked to a center vortex, gives rise naturally to a homotopy $\\Pi_2(S^2)\\simeq\nZ$, a homotopy usually associated with 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles and similar\nobjects which exist by virtue of the presence of an adjoint scalar field which\ngives rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show that certain integrals\nrelated to monopole or topological charge in gauge theories with adjoint\nscalars also appear in the center vortex-nexus picture, but with a different\nphysical interpretation. We find a new type of nexus which can carry\ntopological charge by linking to vortices or carry d=3 Chern-Simons number\nwithout center vortices present; the Chern-Simons number is connected with\ntwisting and writhing of field lines, as the author had suggested earlier. In\ngeneral, no topological charge in d=4 arises from these specific static\nconfigurations, since the charge is the difference of two (equal) Chern-Simons\nnumber, but it can arise through dynamic reconnection processes. We complete\nearlier vortex-nexus work to show explicitly how to express globally-integral\ntopological charge as composed of essentially independent units of charge 1/N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2001 19:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
