Two basic competing models have been offered for\nthis system. According to the first, V1405 Aql is a triple system. The second\nmodel invokes the presence of an accretion disc that precesses in the apsidal\nplane, suggesting that the shorter period is the orbital period while the\nlonger is a positive superhump. The debate on the nature of V1405 Aql has been\ncontinued until very recently. Re-examination of previously published X-ray\ndata reveals an additional periodicity of 2979 s, which is naturally\ninterpreted as a negative superhump. The recently found 4.8-d period is\nconsequently understood as the nodal precession of the disc. This is the first\nfirm detection of negative superhumps and nodal precession in a LMXRB. Our\nresults thus confirm the classification of V1405 Aql as a permanent superhump\nsystem. The 14-year argument on the nature of this intriguing object has thus\nfinally come to an end. We find that the ratio between the negative superhump\ndeficit (over the orbital period) and the positive superhump excess is a\nfunction of orbital period in systems that show both types of superhumps. This\nrelation presents some challenge to theory as it fits binaries with different\ncomponents. We propose that a thickening in the disc rim, which causes\nincreased occultation of the X-ray source, is the mechanism responsible for\nboth types of superhumps in LMXRBs. According to our model superhumps (both in\nthe X-ray and optical regimes) are permitted in high inclination LMXRBs\ncontrary to Haswell et al. (2001) prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2001 04:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

It is shown that in CPW-case i) the atomic momentum distribution is\nasymmetric and somewhat narrower in general; ii) the concept of quasimomentum\nis not applicable and instead the ordinary momentum concerns the problem; iii)\natomic and photonic state distributions are self-consistent, and, in\nconsequence iiii) mean number of photons in the counterpropagating traveling\nwaves and mean atomic momentum match. Explicit analytic expressions for energy\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions are found in Tavis -Cummings-type approximation\n[Phys. Rev. 170, 379(1968)] and is pointed, that it implies only the\nbounded-like states for atomic center-of-mass motion. It is also shown that if\nthe recoil energy is taken into account, the Doppleron resonance is split into\ntwo branches, one of which diverges to Bragg-like resonance in the high-order\nrange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2001 07:36:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
