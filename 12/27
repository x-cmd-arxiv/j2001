Studies of the evolution of the colors, M/L ratios, and\nline indices of early-type galaxies indicate that they have been a highly\nhomogeneous, slowly evolving population over the last ~65% of the age of the\nUniverse. On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that many early-type\ngalaxies in clusters have been transformed from spiral galaxies since z~1.\nArguably the most spectacular evidence for such transformations is the\nincidence of red merger systems in several high redshift clusters. Due to this\nmorphological evolution the sample of early-type galaxies at high redshift is\nonly a subsample of the sample of early-type galaxies at low redshift. This\n``progenitor bias'' results in an overestimate of the mean formation redshift\nif simple models without morphological transformations are used. Models which\nincorporate morphological evolution explicitly can bring the homogeneity, slow\nevolution, and morphological transformations into agreement. The modeling shows\nthat the corrected mean formation redshift of the stars in early-type galaxies\nmay be as low as z~2 in a Lambda dominated Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2001 21:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
