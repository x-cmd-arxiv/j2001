We\nthen cover the basic statistical tools used in cosmology to describe cosmic\nfields, such as correlations functions in real and Fourier space, probability\ndistribution functions, cumulants and generating functions. In subsequent\nsections we review the use of PT to make quantitative predictions about these\nstatistics according to initial conditions, including effects of possible non\nGaussianity of the primordial fields. Results are illustrated by detailed\ncomparisons of PT predictions with numerical simulations. The last sections\ndeal with applications to observations. First we review in detail practical\nestimators of statistics in galaxy catalogs and related errors, including\ntraditional approaches and more recent developments. Then, we consider the\neffects of the bias between the galaxy distribution and the matter\ndistribution, the treatment of redshift distortions in three-dimensional\nsurveys and of projection effects in angular catalogs, and some applications to\nweak gravitational lensing.

In related experiments, we have observed a volatile decision dynamics\nand far-from-optimal payoff distributions. We have also identified ways of\ninformation presentation that can considerably improve the overall performance\nof the system. In order to determine optimal strategies of decision guidance by\nmeans of user-specific recommendations, a stochastic behavioural description is\ndeveloped. These strategies manage to increase the adaptibility to changing\nconditions and to reduce the deviation from the time-dependent user\nequilibrium, thereby enhancing the average and individual payoffs. Hence, our\nguidance strategies can increase the performance of all users by reducing\noverreaction and stabilizing the decision dynamics.
