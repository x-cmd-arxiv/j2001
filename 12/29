Despite these\ndifficulties, we have recently made the first detections of radio and sub-mm\nemission from the host galaxies of GRB980703 and GRB010222, respectively, using\nthe VLA and the SCUBA instrument on JCMT. In both cases we find that the\ninferred star formation rates (~500 solar masses per year) and bolometric\nluminosities (~few 10^12 solar luminosities) indicate that these galaxies are\npossibly analogous to the local population of Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies\n(ULIRGs) undergoing a starburst. However, there is a modest probability that\nthe observed emission is due to AGN activity rather than star formation, thus\nrequiring observations with Chandra or XMM. The sample of GRB hosts offers a\nnumber of unique advantages to the broader question of the evolution of\ngalaxies and star formation from high redshift to the present time since: (i)\nGRBs trace massive stars, (ii) are detectable to high redshifts, and (iii) have\nimmense dust penetrating power.

In this paper we discuss the black hole event horizon, as an\nexample (we leave the cosmological case for future discussion). Starting off\nfrom the field equations of gravity in 5D and some conditions on the metric we\nconstruct a spacetime whose imbedding is a 4D generalization of the\nSchwarzchild metric. The external region of the imbedded spacetime is found to\ncontain two distinct fields. We discuss the properties of the fields and the\npotential implications. Taken as they are, the results suggest that the\ncollapse of matter to form a horizon may have non-local consequences on the\ngeometry of spacetime. In general, the use of horizon-confined mass as a\ncoordinate suggests three potential features of our universe. The first is that\nthe observed 4D spacetime curvature and ordinary matter fields may be hybrid\nfeatures of 5D originating from the mixing of coordinates. Secondly, because\nthe fifth coordinate induces physical fields on the 4D hyperface, the global\nmetric of the universe may not be asymptotically flat.

In this paper we propose an invariant geometric way of selecting those\nLevi form directions that are responsible for the extension. These are the Levi\nform directions of the complex tangent vectors, whose complex planes intersect\nthe tangent cone to the wedge in angles larger than $\\pi/2$. We show by several\nexamples the optimality of this criterion. Applications to regularity of\nCR-functions are also given generalizing the edge-of-the-wedge theorem of\nAjrapetyan-Henkin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2001 11:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
