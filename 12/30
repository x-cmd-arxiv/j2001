Numerical results are presented and compared with\nknown results for models with $\\nu = -1,0,2,\\infty$. It is shown that the\nresults provided by our method are in good agreement with previous results. One\nexpects that the semiclassical quantization rule shown in this paper will\nprovide a good approximation for all principle quantum number even the rule is\nderived in the large principal quantum number limit $n \\gg 1$. We also discuss\nthe power parameter $\\nu $ dependence of the energy spectra pattern in this\npaper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2001 16:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2002 10:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}

Factoring large integers is therefore\nconjectured to be intractable classically, an observation underlying the\nsecurity of widely used cryptographic codes. Quantum computers, however, could\nfactor integers in only polynomial time, using Shor's quantum factoring\nalgorithm. Although important for the study of quantum computers, experimental\ndemonstration of this algorithm has proved elusive. Here we report an\nimplementation of the simplest instance of Shor's algorithm: factorization of\n${N=15}$ (whose prime factors are 3 and 5). We use seven spin-1/2 nuclei in a\nmolecule as quantum bits, which can be manipulated with room temperature liquid\nstate nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. This method of using nuclei to\nstore quantum information is in principle scalable to many quantum bit systems,\nbut such scalability is not implied by the present work. The significance of\nour work lies in the demonstration of experimental and theoretical techniques\nfor precise control and modelling of complex quantum computers. In particular,\nwe present a simple, parameter-free but predictive model of decoherence effects\nin our system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2001 13:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-07"}
