However, this definition of\ngravitational mass cannot give a similar expression like the Cardy-Verlinde\nformula for the entropy associated with the horizon of black holes in de Sitter\nspaces. In this paper, we first generalize the previous discussion to the case\nof Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter solutions. Furthermore, we\nfind that the entropy of black hole horizon can also be rewritten in terms of\nthe Cardy-Verlinde formula for these black holes in de Sitter spaces, if we use\nthe definition due to Abbott and Deser for conserved charges in asymptotically\nde Sitter spaces. We discuss the implication of our result. In addition, we\ngive the first law of de Sitter black hole mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2001 06:44:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2002 12:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
